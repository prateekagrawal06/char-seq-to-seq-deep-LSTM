S"Descriptive Sketches Taken During A Pedestrian Tour Among The Alps\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWERE there, below, a spot of holy ground      Where from distress a refuge might be found,      And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;       Sure, nature's God that spot to man had given      Where falls the purple morning far and wide      In flakes of light upon the mountain side;       Where with loud voice the power of water shakes      The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.        Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,      Who at the call of summer quits his home,         And plods through some wide realm o'er vale and height,      Though seeking only holiday delight;       At least, not owning to himself an aim      To which the sage would give a prouder name.      No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,      Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;       Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,      Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.      For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn;       And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!           Dear is the forest frowning o'er his head,      And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:      Moves there a cloud o'er mid-day's flaming eye?       Upward he looks- 'and calls it luxury:'      Kind Nature's charities his steps attend;       In every babbling brook he finds a friend;       While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed      By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.      Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,      To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;         He views the sun uplift his golden fire,      Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon's lyre;       Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,      To light him shaken by his rugged way.      Back from his sight no bashful children steal;       He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;       His humble looks no shy restraint impart;       Around him plays at will the virgin heart.      While unsuspended wheels the village dance,      The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,           Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,      Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.        A hope, that prudence could not then approve,      That clung to Nature with a truant's love,      O'er Gallia's wastes of corn my footsteps led;       Her files of road-elms, high above my head      In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;       Or where her pathways straggle as they please      By lonely farms and secret villages.      But lo! the Alps ascending white in air,            Toy with the sun and glitter from afar.        And now, emerging from the forest's gloom,      I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom.      Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe      Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear?       'That' Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound,      Chains that were loosened only by the sound      Of holy rites chanted in measured round?       - The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms,      The cloister startles at the gleam of arms.       The thundering tube the aged angler hears,      Bent o'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.      Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,      Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o'erspreads;       Strong terror checks the female peasant's sighs,      And start the astonished shades at female eyes.      From Bruno's forest screams the affrighted jay,      And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.      A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock      The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock.       The 'parting Genius' sighs with hollow breath      Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.      Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds      Portentous through her old woods' trackless bounds,      Vallombre, 'mid her falling fanes, deplores,      For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.        More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves      Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.      No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps      Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.         - To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,      From ringing team apart and grating wain-       To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water's bound,      Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,      Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,      And o'er the whitened wave their shadows fling-       The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;       And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.      The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees      From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;          Or marks, 'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids      Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;       Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view      Stretch o'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,      And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,      As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.      Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed      In golden light; half hides itself in shade:      While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,      Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire:       There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw      Rich golden verdure on the lake below.      Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,      And steals into the shade the lazy oar;       Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,      And amorous music on the water dies.      How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets      Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;       Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales      Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales;             Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,      Each with its household boat beside the door;       Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;       Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows' nests, on high;       That glimmer hoar in eve's last light, descried      Dim from the twilight water's shaggy side,      Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods      Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;       Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,      'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning's ray           Slow-travelling down the western hills, to enfold      Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;       Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell      Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,      And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass      Along the steaming lake, to early mass.      But now farewell to each and all- adieu      To every charm, and last and chief to you,      Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade      Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;            To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,      Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;       Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume      The sylvan cabin's lute-enlivened gloom.      - Alas! the very murmur of the streams      Breathes o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,      While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell      On joys that might disgrace the captive's cell,      Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como's marge,      And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.          Yet are thy softer arts with power indued      To soothe and cheer the poor man's solitude.      By silent cottage-doors, the peasant's home      Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.      But once I pierced the mazes of a wood      In which a cabin undeserted stood;       There an old man an olden measure scanned      On a rude viol touched with withered hand.      As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie      Under a hoary oak's thin canopy,                    Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,      His children's children listened to the sound;       - A Hermit with his family around!         But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles      Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:      Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa's stream,      Where, 'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.      From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire      The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire      To where afar rich orange lustres glow               Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:      Or, led where Via Mala's chasms confine      The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,      Hang o'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom      His burning eyes with fearful light illume.        The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go      O'er life's long deserts with its charge of woe,      With sad congratulation joins the train      Where beasts and men together o'er the plain      Move on- a mighty caravan of pain:                 Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,      Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.      - There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:      Sole human tenant of the piny waste,      By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,      A nursling babe her only comforter;       Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,      A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!         When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows      Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,              And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad      Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road-       She seeks a covert from the battering shower      In the roofed bridge; a the bridge, ill that dread hour,      Itself all trembling at the torrent's power.        Nor is she more at ease on some 'still' night,      When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;       Only the waning moon hangs dull and red      Above a melancholy mountain's head,      Then sets.
