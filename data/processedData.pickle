S'Descriptive Sketches Taken During A Pedestrian Tour Among The Alps\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWERE there, below, a spot of holy ground      Where from distress a refuge might be found,      And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;       Sure, nature\'s God that spot to man had given      Where falls the purple morning far and wide      In flakes of light upon the mountain side;       Where with loud voice the power of water shakes      The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.        Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,      Who at the call of summer quits his home,         And plods through some wide realm o\'er vale and height,      Though seeking only holiday delight;       At least, not owning to himself an aim      To which the sage would give a prouder name.      No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,      Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;       Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,      Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.      For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn;       And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!           Dear is the forest frowning o\'er his head,      And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:      Moves there a cloud o\'er mid-day\'s flaming eye?       Upward he looks- \'and calls it luxury:\'      Kind Nature\'s charities his steps attend;       In every babbling brook he finds a friend;       While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed      By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.      Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,      To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;         He views the sun uplift his golden fire,      Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon\'s lyre;       Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,      To light him shaken by his rugged way.      Back from his sight no bashful children steal;       He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;       His humble looks no shy restraint impart;       Around him plays at will the virgin heart.      While unsuspended wheels the village dance,      The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,           Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,      Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.        A hope, that prudence could not then approve,      That clung to Nature with a truant\'s love,      O\'er Gallia\'s wastes of corn my footsteps led;       Her files of road-elms, high above my head      In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;       Or where her pathways straggle as they please      By lonely farms and secret villages.      But lo! the Alps ascending white in air,            Toy with the sun and glitter from afar.        And now, emerging from the forest\'s gloom,      I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom.      Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe      Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear?       \'That\' Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound,      Chains that were loosened only by the sound      Of holy rites chanted in measured round?       - The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms,      The cloister startles at the gleam of arms.       The thundering tube the aged angler hears,      Bent o\'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.      Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,      Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o\'erspreads;       Strong terror checks the female peasant\'s sighs,      And start the astonished shades at female eyes.      From Bruno\'s forest screams the affrighted jay,      And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.      A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock      The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock.       The \'parting Genius\' sighs with hollow breath      Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.      Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds      Portentous through her old woods\' trackless bounds,      Vallombre, \'mid her falling fanes, deplores,      For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.        More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves      Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.      No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps      Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.         - To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,      From ringing team apart and grating wain-       To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water\'s bound,      Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,      Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,      And o\'er the whitened wave their shadows fling-       The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;       And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.      The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees      From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;          Or marks, \'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids      Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;       Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view      Stretch o\'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,      And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,      As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.      Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed      In golden light; half hides itself in shade:      While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,      Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire:       There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw      Rich golden verdure on the lake below.      Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,      And steals into the shade the lazy oar;       Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,      And amorous music on the water dies.      How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets      Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;       Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales      Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales;             Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,      Each with its household boat beside the door;       Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;       Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows\' nests, on high;       That glimmer hoar in eve\'s last light, descried      Dim from the twilight water\'s shaggy side,      Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods      Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;       Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,      \'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning\'s ray           Slow-travelling down the western hills, to enfold      Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;       Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell      Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,      And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass      Along the steaming lake, to early mass.      But now farewell to each and all- adieu      To every charm, and last and chief to you,      Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade      Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;            To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,      Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;       Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume      The sylvan cabin\'s lute-enlivened gloom.      - Alas! the very murmur of the streams      Breathes o\'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,      While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell      On joys that might disgrace the captive\'s cell,      Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como\'s marge,      And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.          Yet are thy softer arts with power indued      To soothe and cheer the poor man\'s solitude.      By silent cottage-doors, the peasant\'s home      Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.      But once I pierced the mazes of a wood      In which a cabin undeserted stood;       There an old man an olden measure scanned      On a rude viol touched with withered hand.      As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie      Under a hoary oak\'s thin canopy,                    Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,      His children\'s children listened to the sound;       - A Hermit with his family around!         But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles      Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:      Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa\'s stream,      Where, \'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.      From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire      The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire      To where afar rich orange lustres glow               Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:      Or, led where Via Mala\'s chasms confine      The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,      Hang o\'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom      His burning eyes with fearful light illume.        The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go      O\'er life\'s long deserts with its charge of woe,      With sad congratulation joins the train      Where beasts and men together o\'er the plain      Move on- a mighty caravan of pain:                 Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,      Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.      - There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:      Sole human tenant of the piny waste,      By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,      A nursling babe her only comforter;       Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,      A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!         When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows      Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,              And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad      Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road-       She seeks a covert from the battering shower      In the roofed bridge; a the bridge, ill that dread hour,      Itself all trembling at the torrent\'s power.        Nor is she more at ease on some \'still\' night,      When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;       Only the waning moon hangs dull and red      Above a melancholy mountain\'s head,      Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,              Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;       Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,      Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,      Listens, or quakes while from the forest\'s gulf      Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf.        From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide      Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide;       By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,      Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;       By cells upon whose image, while he prays,              The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;       By many a votive death-cross planted near,      And watered duly with the pious tear,      That faded silent from the upward eye      Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh;       Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves      Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves.        But soon a peopled region on the sight      Opens- a little world of calm delight;       Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,             Spread rooflike o\'er the deep secluded vale,      And beams of evening slipping in between,      Gently illuminate a sober scene:-       Here, on the brown wood-cottages they sleep,      There, over rock or sloping pasture creep.      On as we journey, in clear view displayed,      The still vale lengthens underneath its shade      Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead      The green light sparkles; - the dim bowers recede.      While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,         And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,      In solemn shapes before the admiring eye      Dilated hang the misty pines on high,      Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,      And antique castles seen through gleamy showers.        From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!       To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri\'s lake      In Nature\'s pristine majesty outspread,      Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread:      The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch               Far o\'er the water, hung with groves of beech;       Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,      Nor stop but where creation seems to end.      Yet here and there, if mid the savage scene      Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,      Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep      To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep,      - Before those thresholds (never can they know      The face of traveller passing to and fro,)       No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell                 For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;       Their watch-dog ne\'er his angry bark foregoes,      Touched by the beggar\'s moan of human woes;       The shady porch ne\'er offered a cool seat      To pilgrims overcome by summer\'s heat.      Yet thither the world\'s business finds its way      At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,      And \'there\' are those fond thoughts which Solitude,      However stern, is powerless to exclude.      There doth the maiden watch her lover\'s sail                Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;       At midnight listens till his parting oar,      And its last echo, can be heard no more.        And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons, cry      Amid tempestuous vapours driving by,      Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear      That common growth of earth, the foodful ear;       Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,      And pines the unripened pear in summer\'s kindliest ray;       Contentment shares the desolate domain                     With Independence, child of high Disdain.      Exulting \'mid the winter of the skies,      Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,      And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;       And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds      The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,      And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,      Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste      Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast.        Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour,           All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:      The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:      Dark is the region as with coming night;       But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!       Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,      Glances the wheeling eagle\'s glorious form!       Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine      The wood-crowned cliffs that o\'er the lake recline;       Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold,      At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:            Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun      The \'west\', that burns like one dilated sun,      A crucible of mighty compass, felt      By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt.        But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before      The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;       Confused the Marathonian tale appears,      While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears.      And who, that walks where men of ancient days      Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,              Feels not the spirit of the place control,      Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul?       Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,      Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,      On Zutphen\'s plain; or on that highland dell,      Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell      What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought      Of him whom passion rivets to the spot,      Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe\'s happiest sigh,      And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard\'s eye;                    Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,      And glad Dundee in \'faint huzzas\' expired?         But now with other mind I stand alone      Upon the summit of this naked cone,      And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase      His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space,        Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave      A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,      Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;       Thro\' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;          Where silent Hours their deathlike sway extend,      Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend      Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned      In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,      Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound.      - \'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,      To see a planet\'s pomp and steady light      In the least star of scarce-appearing night;       While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound      Of ether, shining with diminished round,                    And far and wide the icy summits blaze,      Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:      To him the day-star glitters small and bright,      Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,      And he can look beyond the sun, and view      Those fast-receding depths of sable blue      Flying till vision can no more pursue!       - At once bewildering mists around him close,      And cold and hunger are his least of woes;       The Demon of the snow, with angry roar                       Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.      Soon with despair\'s whole weight his spirits sink;       Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;       And, ere his eyes can close upon the day,      The eagle of the Alps o\'ershades her prey.        Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar,      Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;       Or rather stay to taste the mild delights      Of pensive Underwalden\'s pastoral heights.      - Is there who \'mid these awful wilds has seen                 The native Genii walk the mountain green?       Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,      Soft music o\'er the aerial summit steal?       While o\'er the desert, answering every close,      Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.      - And sure there is a secret Power that reigns      Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,      Nought but the \'chalets\', flat and bare, on high      Suspended \'mid the quiet of the sky;       Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,                And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep.      How still! no irreligious sound or sight      Rouses the soul from her severe delight.      An idle voice the sabbath region fills      Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,      And with that voice accords the soothing sound      Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;       Faint wail of eagle melting into blue      Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods\' steady \'sugh\';       The solitary heifer\'s deepened low;                        Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow.      All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,      Blend in a music of tranquillity;       Save when, a stranger seen below, the boy      Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.        When, from the sunny breast of open seas,      And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze      Comes on to gladden April with the sight      Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height;       When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,              And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,      The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,      Leaving to silence the deserted vale;       And like the Patriarchs in their simple age      Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage:      High and more high in summer\'s heat they go,      And hear the rattling thunder far below;       Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,      Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd.        One I behold who, \'cross the foaming flood,              Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;       Another, high on that green ledge; - he gained      The tempting spot with every sinew strained;       And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,      Food for his beasts in time of winter snows.      - Far different life from what Tradition hoar      Transmits of happier lot in times of yore!       Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed      From out the rocks, the wild bees\' safe abode:      Continual waters welling cheered the waste,               And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:      Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,      Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:      Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,      To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare.      Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,      And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,      Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand.      Thus does the father to his children tell      Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well.          Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod      Of angry Nature to avenge her God.      Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts      Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.        \'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows      More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.      Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,      A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,      A solemn sea! whose billows wide around      Stand motionless, to awful silence bound:              Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,      That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.      A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,      Gapes in the centre of the sea- and, through      That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound      Innumerable streams with roar profound.      Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,      And merry flageolet; the low of herds,      The bark of dogs, the heifer\'s tinkling bell,      Talk, laughter, and perchance a churchtower knell:       Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed      And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised:      Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less      Alive to independent happiness,      Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at eventide      Upon the fragrant mountain\'s purple side:      For as the pleasures of his simple day      Beyond his native valley seldom stray,      Nought round its darling precincts can he find      But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;           While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure\'s urn,      Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return.        Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,      Was blest as free- for he was Nature\'s child.      He, all superior but his God disdained,      Walked none restraining, and by none restrained      Confessed no law but what his reason taught,      Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought.      As man in his primeval dower arrayed      The image of his glorious Sire displayed,                 Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here      The traces of primeval Man appear;       The simple dignity no forms debase;       The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:      The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,      His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword;       Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared      With this \'the blessings he enjoys to guard.\'        And, as his native hills encircle ground      For many a marvellous victory renowned,                The work of Freedom daring to oppose,      With few in arms, innumerable foes,      When to those famous fields his steps are led,      An unknown power connects him with the dead:      For images of other worlds are there;       Awful the light, and holy is the air.      Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,      Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;       His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,      Beyond the senses and their little reign.                  And oft, when that dread vision hath past by,      He holds with God himself communion high,      There where the peal of swelling torrents fills      The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;       Or when, upon the mountain\'s silent brow      Reclined, he sees, above him and below,      Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;       While needle peaks of granite shooting bare      Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.      And when a gathering weight of shadows brown             Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;       And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms,      Uplift in quiet their illumined forms,      In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,      Tinged like an angel\'s smile all rosy red-       Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,      And the near heavens impart their own delights.        When downward to his winter hut he goes,      Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;       That hut which on the hills so oft employs               His thoughts, the central point of all his joys.      And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,      Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,      So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends      A little prattling child, he oft descends,      To glance a look upon the well-matched pair;       Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.      There, safely guarded by the woods behind,      He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,      Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,           And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound.        Through Nature\'s vale his homely pleasures glide,      Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;       The bound of all his vanity, to deck,      With one bright bell, a favourite heifer\'s neck;       Well pleased upon some simple annual feast,      Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,      If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,      Of thrice ten summers dignify the board.      - Alas! in every clime a flying ray                        Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;       And here the unwilling mind may more than trace      The general sorrows of the human race;       The churlish gales of penury, that blow      Cold as the north-wind o\'er a waste of snow,      To them the gentle groups of bliss deny      That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.      Yet more; - compelled by Powers which only deign      That \'solitary\' man disturb their reign,      Powers that support an unremitting strife               With all the tender charities of life,      Full oft the father, when his sons have grown      To manhood, seems their title to disown;       And from his nest amid the storms of heaven      Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;       With stern composure watches to the plain-       And never, eagle-like, beholds again!         When long-familiar joys are all resigned,      Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind?       Lo! where through flat Batavia\'s willowy groves,           Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;       O\'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,      And search the affections to their inmost cell;       Sweet poison spreads along the listener\'s veins,      Turning past pleasures into mortal pains;       Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,      Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave.        Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!       Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume!       Fresh gales and dews of life\'s delicious morn,            And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!       Alas! the little joy to man allowed      Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud;       Or like the beauty in a flower installed,      Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.      Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,      And taught that pain is pleasure\'s natural heir,      We still confide in more than we can know;       Death would be else the favourite friend of woe.        \'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,          Between interminable tracts of pine,      Within a temple stands an awful shrine,      By an uncertain light revealed, that falls      On the mute Image and the troubled walls.      Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain      That views, undimmed, Einsiedlen\'s wretched fane.      While ghastly faces through the gloom appear,      Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear;       While prayer contends with silenced agony,      Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.                 If the sad grave of human ignorance bear      One flower of hope- oh, pass and leave it there!         The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire,      Flings o\'er the wilderness a stream of fire:      Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day      Close on the remnant of their weary way;       While they are drawing toward the sacred floor      Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more.      How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste      The fountains reared for them amid the waste!           Their thirst they slake:- they wash their toil-worn feet      And some with tears of joy each other greet.      Yes, I must see you when ye first behold      Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,      In that glad moment will for you a sigh      Be heaved, of charitable sympathy;       In that glad moment when your hands are prest      In mute devotion on the thankful breast!         Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields      With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields:           Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,      And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend; -       A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns      Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;       Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:      \'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned,      They sport beneath that mountain\'s matchless height      That holds no commerce with the summer night.      From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds      The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;                     Appalling havoc! but serene his brow,      Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow;       Glitter the stars above, and all is black below.        What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,      While roars the sullen Arve in anger by,      That not for thy reward, unrivalled Vale!       Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;       That thou, the slaves of slaves, art doomed to pine      And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,      To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine.             Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,      With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way,      On the bleak sides of Cumbria\'s heath-clad moors,      Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland\'s shores;       To scent the sweets of Piedmont\'s breathing rose,      And orange gale that o\'er Lugano blows;       Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,      That virtue languishes and pleasure fails,      While the remotest hamlets blessings share      In thy loved presence known, and only there;                 \'Heart\'-blessings- outward treasures too which the eye      Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,      And every passing breeze will testify.      There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound      Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound;       The housewife there a brighter garden sees,      Where hum on busier wing her happy bees;       On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;       And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,-       To greet the traveller needing food and rest;            Housed for the night, or but a half-hour\'s guest.        And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees      Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;       Though martial songs have banished songs of love,      And nightingales desert the village grove,      Scared by the fife and rumbling drum\'s alarms,      And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;       That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,      Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!       - Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power         Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:      All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes      Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.      Yes, as I roamed where Loiret\'s waters glide      Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,      When from October clouds a milder light      Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;       Methought from every cot the watchful bird      Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;       Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,            Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;       Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf      Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief;       The measured echo of the distant flail      Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;       With more majestic course the water rolled,      And ripening foliage shone with richer gold.      - But foes are gathering- Liberty must raise      Red on the hills her beacon\'s far-seen blaze;       Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower! -              Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour!       Rejoice, brave Land, though pride\'s perverted ire      Rouse hell\'s own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:      Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;       As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth!       - All cannot be: the promise is too fair      For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:      Yet not for this will sober reason frown      Upon that promise, nor the hope disown;       She knows that only from high aims ensue                     Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due.        Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed      In an impartial balance, give thine aid      To the just cause; and, oh! do thou preside      Over the mighty stream now spreading wide:      So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied      In copious showers, from earth by wholesome springs,      Brood o\'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings!       And grant that every sceptred child of clay      Who cries presumptuous, \'Here the flood shall stay,\'                 May in its progress see thy guiding hand,      And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand;       Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore,      Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more!         To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot      Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot      In timely sleep; and when, at break of day,      On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play,      With a light heart our course we may renew,      The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.                    1791 & 1792.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Oak Of Guernica Supposed Address To The Same\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOAK of Guernica!

Shall this be so?That such a Boy where\'er he lists shall goIn your despite, and sing his hymns and saws,Which is against the reverence of our laws!\'XVII\'From that day forward have the Jews conspiredOut of the world this Innocent to chase;And to this end a Homicide they hired,That in an alley had a privy place,And, as the Child \'gan to the school to pace,This cruel Jew him seized, and held him fastAnd cut his throat, and in a pit him cast.XVIII\'I say that him into a pit they threw,A loathsome pit, whence noisome scents exhale;O cursed folk! away, ye Herods new!What may your ill intentions you avail?Murder will out; certes it will not fail;Know, that the honour of high God may spread,The blood cries out on your accursed deed.XIX\'O Martyr \'stablished in virginity!Now may\'st thou sing for aye before the throne,Following the Lamb celestial,\' quoth she,\'Of which the great Evangelist, Saint John,In Patmos wrote, who saith of them that goBefore the Lamb singing continually,That never fleshly woman they did know.XX\'Now this poor widow waiteth all that nightAfter her little Child, and he came not;For which, by earliest glimpse of morning light,With face all pale with dread and busy thought,She at the School and elsewhere him hath soughtUntil thus far she learned, that he had beenIn the Jews\' street, and there he last was seen.XXI\'With Mother\'s pity in her breast enclosedShe goeth, as she were half out of her mind,To every place wherein she hath supposedBy likelihood her little Son to find;And ever on Christ\'s Mother meek and kindShe cried, till to the Jewry she was brought,And him among the accursed Jews she sought.XXII\'She asketh, and she piteously doth prayTo every Jew that dwelleth in that placeTo tell her if her child had passed that way;They all said--Nay; but Jesu of his graceGave to her thought, that in a little spaceShe for her Son in that same spot did cryWhere he was cast into a pit hard by.XXIII\'O thou great God that dost perform thy laudBy mouths of Innocents, lo! here thy might;This gem of chastity, this emerald,And eke of martyrdom this ruby bright,There, where with mangled throat he lay upright,The \'Alma Redemptoris\' \'gan to sing,So loud, that with his voice the place did ring.XXIV\'The Christian folk that through the Jewry wentCome to the spot in wonder at the thing;And hastily they for the Provost sent;Immediately he came, not tarrying,And praiseth Christ that is our heavenly King,And eke his Mother, honour of Mankind:Which done he bade that they the Jews should bind.XXV\'This Child with piteous lamentation thenWas taken up, singing his song alway;And with procession great and pomp of menTo the next Abbey him they bare away;His Mother swooning by the body lay:And scarcely could the people that were nearRemove this second Rachel from the bier.XXVI\'Torment and shameful death to every oneThis Provost doth for those bad Jews prepareThat of this murder wist, and that anon:Such wickedness his judgments cannot spare;Who will do evil, evil shall he bear;Them therefore with wild horses did he draw,And after that he hung them by the law.XXVII\'Upon his bier this Innocent doth lieBefore the altar while the Mass doth last:The Abbot with his convent\'s companyThen sped themselves to bury him full fast;And, when they holy water on him cast,Yet spake this Child when sprinkled was the water,And sang, \'O Alma Redemptoris Mater!\'XXVIII\'This Abbot, for he was a holy man,As all Monks are, or surely ought to be,In supplication to the Child beganThus saying, \'O dear Child! I summon theeIn virtue of the holy TrinityTell me the cause why thou dost sing this hymnSince that thy throat is cut, as it doth seem.\'XXIX\'\'My throat is cut unto the bone, I trow,\'Said this young Child, \'and by the law of kindI should have died, yea many hours ago;But Jesus Christ, as in the books ye find,Will that his glory last, and be in mind;And, for the worship of his Mother dear,Yet may I sing \'O Alma!\' loud and clear.XXX\'\'This well of mercy, Jesu\'s Mother sweet,After my knowledge I have loved alway;And in the hour when I my death did meetTo me she came, and thus to me did say,\'Thou in thy dying sing this holy lay,\'As ye have heard; and soon as I had sungMethought she laid a grain upon my tongue.XXXI\'\'Wherefore I sing, nor can from song refrain,In honour of that blissful Maiden free,Till from my tongue off-taken is the grain;And after that thus said she unto me;\'My little Child, then will I come for theeSoon as the grain from off thy tongue they take:Be not dismayed, I will not thee forsake!\'XXXII\'This holy Monk, this Abbot--him mean I,Touched then his tongue, and took away the grain;And he gave up the ghost full peacefully;And, when the Abbot had this wonder seen,His salt tears trickled down like showers of rain;And on his face he dropped upon the ground,And still he lay as if he had been bound.XXXIII\'Eke the whole Convent on the pavement lay,Weeping and praising Jesu\'s Mother dear;And after that they rose, and took their way,And lifted up this Martyr from the bier,And in a tomb of precious marble clearEnclosed his uncorrupted body sweet.--Where\'er he be, God grant us him to meet!XXXIV\'Young Hew of Lincoln! in like sort laid lowBy cursed Jews--thing well and widely known,For it was done a little while ago--Pray also thou for us, while here we tarryWeak sinful folk, that God, with pitying eye,In mercy would his mercy multiplyOn us, for reverence of his Mother Mary!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo The Spade Of A Friend (An Agriculturist)\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCOMPOSED WHILE WE WERE LABOURING TOGETHER IN HIS PLEASURE-GROUNDSPADE! with which Wilkinson hath tilled his lands,And shaped these pleasant walks by Emont\'s side,Thou art a tool of honour in my hands;I press thee, through the yielding soil, with pride.Rare master has it been thy lot to know;Long hast Thou served a man to reason true;Whose life combines the best of high and low,The labouring many and the resting few;Health, meekness, ardour, quietness secure,And industry of body and of mind; And elegant enjoyments, that are pureAs nature is; too pure to be refined.Here often hast Thou heard the Poet singIn concord with his river murmuring by;Or in some silent field, while timid springIs yet uncheered by other minstrelsy.Who shall inherit Thee when death has laidLow in the darksome cell thine own dear lord?That man will have a trophy, humble Spade!A trophy nobler than a conqueror\'s sword.

Him will I take, and in close covert keep,\'Mid groves Idalian, lulled to gentle sleep,Or on Cythera\'s far-sequestered steep,That he may neither know what hope is mine,Nor by his presence traverse the design.Do thou, but for a single night\'s brief space,Dissemble; be that boy in form and face!And when enraptured Dido shall receiveThee to her arms, and kisses interweaveWith many a fond embrace, while joy runs high, And goblets crown the proud festivity,Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire,At every touch, an unsuspected fire.\'Love, at the word, before his mother\'s sightPuts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight,Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dewsOf slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuseThe true Ascanius steeped in placid rest;Then wafts him, cherished on her careful breast,Through upper air to an Idalian glade, Where he on soft \'amaracus\' is laid,With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade.But Cupid, following cheerily his guideAchates, with the gifts to Carthage hied;And, as the hall he entered, there, betweenThe sharers of her golden couch, was seenReclined in festal pomp the Tyrian queen.The Trojans, too (Aeneas at their head),On conches lie, with purple overspread:Meantime in canisters is heaped the bread, Pellucid water for the hands is borne,And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn.Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare,As they in order stand, the dainty fare;And fume the household deities with storeOf odorous incense; while a hundred moreMatched with an equal number of like age,But each of manly sex, a docile page,Marshal the banquet, giving with due graceTo cup or viand its appointed place. The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.They look with wonder on the gifts--they gazeUpon Iulus, dazzled with the raysThat from his ardent countenance are flung,And charmed to hear his simulating tongue;Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine,Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.But chiefly Dido, to the coming illDevoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill; She views the gifts; upon the child then turnsInsatiable looks, and gazing burns.To ease a father\'s cheated love he hungUpon Aeneas, and around him clung;Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries;She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes,Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)How great a God, incumbent o\'er her breast,Would fill it with his spirit. He, to pleaseHis Acidalian mother, by degrees Blots out Sichaeus, studious to removeThe dead, by influx of a living love,By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest.Troubling a heart that had been long at rest.Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceasedThe first division of the splendid feast,While round a vacant board the chiefs recline,Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine;Voices of gladness roll the walls around;Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound; From gilded rafters many a blazing lightDepends, and torches overcome the night.The minutes fly--till, at the queen\'s command,A bowl of state is offered to her hand:Then she, as Belus wont, and all the lineFrom Belus, filled it to the brim with wine;Silence ensued. \'O Jupiter, whose careIs hospitable dealing, grant my prayer!Productive day be this of lasting joyTo Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy; A day to future generations dear!Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick\'ning cheer,Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near!And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours waitUpon this hour, the bond to celebrate!\'She spake and shed an offering on the board;Then sipped the bowl whence she the wine had pouredAnd gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord;He raised the bowl, and took a long deep draught;Then every chief in turn the beverage quaffed. Graced with redundant hair, Iopas singsThe lore of Atlas, to resounding strings,The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings;When human kind, and brute; what natural powersEngender lightning, whence are falling showers.He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twainThe glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain;--Why suns in winter, shunning heaven\'s steep heightsPost seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights.The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause.--But, lengthening out the night with converse new,Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew;Of Priam asked, of Hector--o\'er and o\'er--What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;--What steeds the car of Diomed could boast;Among the leaders of the Grecian host.How looked Achilles, their dread paramount--\'But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount,Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source, Your own grief and your friends?--your wandering course;For now, till this seventh summer have ye rangedThe sea, or trod the earth, to peace estranged.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Thomas Clarkson\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nON THE FINAL PASSING OF THE BILL FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADEMARCH 1807CLARKSON! it was an obstinate hill to climb:How toilsome--nay, how dire--it was, by theeIs known; by none, perhaps, so feelingly:But thou, who, starting in thy fervent prime,Didst first lead forth that enterprise sublime,Hast heard the constant Voice its charge repeat,Which, out of thy young heart\'s oracular seat,First roused thee.--O true yoke-fellow of Time,Duty\'s intrepid liegeman, see, the palmIs won, and by all Nations shall be worn!

News from Mona\'s Isle?Such have we, but unvaried in its style; No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whenceAnd wherefore fugitive or on what pretence;Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the windMost restlessly alive when most confined.Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appeaseThe mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS;The last year\'s cup whose Ram or Heifer gained,What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained:An eye of fancy only can I castOn that proud pageant now at hand or past, When full five hundred boats in trim array,With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay,And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer,For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair,Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shineLike beds of moonlight shifting on the brine.Mona from our Abode is daily seen,But with a wilderness of waves between;And by conjecture only can we speakOf aught transacted there in bay or creek; No tidings reach us thence from town or field,Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield,And some we gather from the misty air,And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare.But these poetic mysteries I withhold;For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold,And should the colder fit with You be onWhen You might read, my credit would be gone.Let more substantial themes the pen engage,And nearer interests culled from the opening stage Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawnHad from the east her silver star withdrawn,The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door,Thoughtfully freighted with a various store;And long or ere the uprising of the SunO\'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun,A needful journey, under favouring skies,Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guiseOf those old Patriarchs when from well to wellThey roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabsdwell. Say first, to whom did we the charge confide,Who promptly undertook the Wain to guideUp many a sharply-twining road and down,And over many a wide hill\'s craggy crown,Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook,And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook?A blooming Lass--who in her better handBore a light switch, her sceptre of commandWhen, yet a slender Girl, she often led,Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar\'s head.What could go wrong with such a CharioteerFor goods and chattels, or those Infants dear,A Pair who smilingly sate side by side,Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tideWhose free embraces we were bound to seek,Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek?Such hope did either Parent entertainPacing behind along the silent lane.Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight, For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight--On a green bank a creature stood forlornJust half protruded to the light of morn,Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thornThe Figure called to mind a beast of preyStript of its frightful powers by slow decay,And, though no longer upon rapine bent,Dim memory keeping of its old intent.We started, looked again with anxious eyes,And in that griesly object recognise The Curate\'s Dog--his long-tried friend, for they,As well we knew, together had grown grey.The Master died, his drooping servant\'s griefFound at the Widow\'s feet some sad relief;Yet still he lived in pining discontent,Sadness which no indulgence could prevent;Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleepsAnd lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps;Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute!Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute, And of all visible motion destitute,So that the very heaving of his breathSeemed stopt, though by some other power than death.Long as we gazed upon the form and face,A mild domestic pity kept its place,Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hueThat haunted us in spite of what we knew.Even now I sometimes think of him as lostIn second-sight appearances, or crostBy spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground, On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound,Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to waitIn days of old romance at Archimago\'s gate.Advancing Summer, Nature\'s law fulfilled,The choristers in every grove had stilled;But we, we lacked not music of our own,For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown,Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues,Some notes prelusive, from the round of songsWith which, more zealous than the liveliest bird That in wild Arden\'s brakes was ever heard,Her work and her work\'s partners she can cheer,The whole day long, and all days of the year.Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we passAnd soon approach Diana\'s Looking-glass!To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven,Such name Italian fancy would have given,Ere on its banks the few grey cabins roseThat yet disturb not its concealed reposeMore than the feeblest wind that idly blows. Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the roadStopped me at once by charm of what it showed,The encircling region vividly exprestWithin the mirror\'s depth, a world at rest--Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield,And the smooth green of many a pendent field,And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small,A little daring would-be waterfall,One chimney smoking and its azure wreath,Associate all in the calm Pool beneath, With here and there a faint imperfect gleamOf water-lilies veiled in misty steam--What wonder at this hour of stillness deep,A shadowy link \'tween wakefulness and sleep,When Nature\'s self, amid such blending, seemsTo render visible her own soft dreams,If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood,Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood,A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by TheeDesigned to rise in humble privacy, A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread,Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful headHalf hid in native trees. Alas \'tis not,Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spotUnconscious of its own untoward lot,And thought in silence, with regret too keen,Of unexperienced joys that might have been;Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts,And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts.But time, irrevocable time, is flown. And let us utter thanks for blessings sownAnd reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own.Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee,Startling us all, dispersed my reverie;Such shout as many a sportive echo meetingOft-times from Alpine \'chalets\' sends a greeting.Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant standOn high, a kerchief waving in her hand!Not unexpectant that by early dayOur little Band would thrid this mountain way, Before her cottage on the bright hill sideShe hath advanced with hope to be descried.Right gladly answering signals we displayed,Moving along a tract of morning shade,And vocal wishes sent of like good willTo our kind Friend high on the sunny hill--Luminous region, fair as if the primeWere tempting all astir to look aloft or climb;Only the centre of the shining cotWith door left open makes a gloomy spot, Emblem of those dark corners sometimes foundWithin the happiest breast on earthly ground.Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale,And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale;Descend, and reach, in Yewdale\'s depths, a plainWith haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain--An area level as a Lake and spreadUnder a rock too steep for man to tread,Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwestAloft the Raven hangs a visible nest, Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest.Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark,At our approach, a jealous watch-dog\'s bark,Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state,But the whole household, that our coming wait.With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange,And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly GrangePress forward by the teasing dogs unscared.Entering, we find the morning meal prepared:So down we sit, though not till each had cast Pleased looks around the delicate repast--Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest,With amber honey from the mountain\'s breast;Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wildOf children\'s industry, in hillocks piled;Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lieUpon a lordly dish; frank hospitalityWhere simple art with bounteous nature vied,And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride.Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast, If thou be lovelier than the kindling East,Words by thy presence unrestrained may speakOf a perpetual dawn from brow and cheekInstinct with light whose sweetest promise lies,Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes,Dark but to every gentle feeling true,As if their lustre flowed from ether\'s purest blue.Let me not ask what tears may have been weptBy those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept,Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relievedBy fortitude and patience, and the graceOf heaven in pity visiting the place.Not unadvisedly those secret springsI leave unsearched: enough that memory clings,Here as elsewhere, to notices that makeTheir own significance for hearts awake,To rural incidents, whose genial powersFilled with delight three summer morning hours.More cold my pen report of grave or gay That through our gipsy travel cheered the way;But, bursting forth above the waves, the SunLaughs at my pains, and seems to say, \'Be done.\'Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reproveThis humble offering made by Truth to Love,Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spellWhich might have else been on me yet:--FAREWELL.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Martial Courage Of A Day Is Vain\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE martial courage of a day is vain,An empty noise of death the battle\'s roar,If vital hope be wanting to restore,Or fortitude be wanting to sustain,Armies or kingdoms.

January 18, 1816\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIHAIL, orient Conqueror of gloomy Night!Thou that canst shed the bliss of gratitudeOn hearts howe\'er insensible or rude;Whether thy punctual visitations smiteThe haughty towers where monarchs dwell;Or thou, impartial Sun, with presence brightCheer\'st the low threshold of the peasant\'s cell!Not unrejoiced I see thee climb the skyIn naked splendour, clear from mist or haze,Or cloud approaching to divert the rays,Which even in deepest winter testifyThy power and majesty,Dazzling the vision that presumes to gaze.--Well does thine aspect usher in this Day;As aptly suits therewith that modest paceSubmitted to the chainsThat bind thee to the path which God ordainsThat thou shalt trace,Till, with the heavens and earth, thou pass away!Nor less, the stillness of these frosty plains,Their utter stillness, and the silent graceOf yon ethereal summits white with snow,(Whose tranquil pomp and spotless purityReport of storms gone byTo us who tread below)Do with the service of this Day accord.--Divinest Object which the uplifted eyeOf mortal man is suffered to behold;Thou, who upon those snow-clad Heights has pouredMeek lustre, nor forget\'st the humble Vale;Thou who dost warm Earth\'s universal mould,And for thy bounty wert not unadoredBy pious men of old;Once more, heart-cheering Sun, I bid thee hail!Bright be thy course to-day, let not this promise fail!II\'Mid the deep quiet of this morning hour,All nature seems to hear me while I speak,By feelings urged that do not vainly seekApt language, ready as the tuneful notesThat stream in blithe succession from the throatsOf birds, in leafy bower,Warbling a farewell to a vernal shower.--There is a radiant though a short-lived flame,That burns for Poets in the dawning east;And oft my soul hath kindled at the same,When the captivity of sleep had ceased;But He who fixed immoveably the frameOf the round world, and built, by laws as strong,A solid refuge for distress--The towers of righteousness;He knows that from a holier altar cameThe quickening spark of this day\'s sacrifice;Knows that the source is nobler whence doth riseThe current of this matin song;That deeper far it liesThan aught dependent on the fickle skies.IIIHave we not conquered?--by the vengeful sword?Ah no, by dint of Magnanimity;That curbed the baser passions, and left freeA loyal band to follow their liege LordClear-sighted Honour, and his staid Compeers,Along a track of most unnatural years;In execution of heroic deedsWhose memory, spotless as the crystal beadsOf morning dew upon the untrodden meads,Shall live enrolled above the starry spheres.He, who in concert with an earthly stringOf Britain\'s acts would sing,He with enraptured voice will tellOf One whose spirit no reverse could quell;Of One that \'mid the failing never failed--Who paints how Britain struggled and prevailedShall represent her labouring with an eyeOf circumspect humanity;Shall show her clothed with strength and skill,All martial duties to fulfil;Firm as a rock in stationary fight;In motion rapid as the lightning\'s gleam;Fierce as a flood-gate bursting at midnightTo rouse the wicked from their giddy dream--Woe, woe to all that face her in the field!Appalled she may not be, and cannot yield.IVAnd thus is \'missed\' the sole true gloryThat can belong to human story!At which they only shall arriveWho through the abyss of weakness dive.The very humblest are too proud of heart;And one brief day is rightly set apartFor Him who lifteth up and layeth low;For that Almighty God to whom we owe,Say not that we have vanquished--but that we survive.VHow dreadful the dominion of the impure!Why should the Song be tardy to proclaimThat less than power unbounded could not tameThat soul of Evil--which, from hell let loose,Had filled the astonished world with such abuseAs boundless patience only could endure?--Wide-wasted regions--cities wrapt in flame--Who sees, may lift a streaming eyeTo Heaven;--who never saw, may heave a sigh;But the foundation of our nature shakes,And with an infinite pain the spirit aches,When desolated countries, towns on fire,Are but the avowed attireOf warfare waged with desperate mindAgainst the life of virtue in mankind;Assaulting without ruthThe citadels of truth;While the fair gardens of civility,By ignorance defaced,By violence laid waste,Perish without reprieve for flower or tree!VIA crouching purpose--a distracted will--Opposed to hopes that battened upon scorn,And to desires whose ever-waxing hornNot all the light of earthly power could fill;Opposed to dark, deep plots of patient skill,And to celerities of lawless force;Which, spurning God, had flung away remorse--What could they gain but shadows of redress?--So bad proceeded propagating worse;And discipline was passion\'s dire excess.Widens the fatal web, its lines extend,And deadlier poisons in the chalice blend.When will your trials teach you to be wise?--O prostrate Lands, consult your agonies!VIINo more--the guilt is banished,And, with the guilt, the shame is fled;And, with the guilt and shame, the Woe hath vanished,Shaking the dust and ashes from her head!--No more--these lingerings of distressSully the limpid stream of thankfulness.What robe can Gratitude employSo seemly as the radiant vest of Joy?What steps so suitable as those that moveIn prompt obedience to spontaneous measuresOf glory, and felicity, and love,Surrendering the whole heart to sacred pleasures?VIIIO Britain! dearer far than life is dear,If one there beOf all thy progenyWho can forget thy prowess, never moreBe that ungrateful Son allowed to hearThy green leaves rustle or thy torrents roar.As springs the lion from his den,As from a forest-brakeUpstarts a glistering snake,The bold Arch-despot re-appeared;--againWide Europe heaves, impatient to be cast,With all her armed Powers,On that offensive soil, like waves upon a thousand shores.The trumpet blew a universal blast!But Thou art foremost in the field:--there stand:Receive the triumph destined to thy hand!All States have glorified themselves;--their claimsAre weighed by Providence, in balance even;And now, in preference to the mightiest names,To Thee the exterminating sword is given.Dread mark of approbation, justly gained!Exalted office, worthily sustained!IXPreserve, O Lord! within our heartsThe memory of thy favour,That else insensibly departs,And loses its sweet savour!Lodge it within us!--as the power of lightLives inexhaustibly in precious gems,Fixed on the front of Eastern diadems,So shine our thankfulness for ever bright!What offering, what transcendent monumentShall our sincerity to Thee present?--Not work of hands; but trophies that may reachTo highest Heaven--the labour of the Soul;That builds, as thy unerring precepts teach,Upon the internal conquests made by each,Her hope of lasting glory for the whole.Yet will not heaven disown nor earth gainsayThe outward service of this day;Whether the worshippers entreatForgiveness from God\'s mercy-seat;Or thanks and praises to His throne ascendThat He has brought our warfare to an end,And that we need no second victory!--Ha! what a ghastly sight for man to see;And to the heavenly saints in peace who dwell,For a brief moment, terrible;But, to thy sovereign penetration, fair,Before whom all things are, that were,All judgments that have been, or e\'er shall be;Links in the chain of thy tranquillity!Along the bosom of this favoured Nation,Breathe Thou, this day, a vital undulation!Let all who do this land inheritBe conscious of thy moving spirit!Oh, \'tis a goodly Ordinance,--the sight,Though sprung from bleeding war, is one of pure delight;Bless Thou the hour, or ere the hour arrive,When a whole people shall kneel down in prayer,And, at one moment, in one rapture, striveWith lip and heart to tell their gratitudeFor thy protecting care,Their solemn joy--praising the Eternal LordFor tyranny subdued,And for the sway of equity renewed,For liberty confirmed, and peace restored!XBut hark--the summons!--down the placid lakeFloats the soft cadence of the church-tower bells;Bright shines the Sun, as if his beams would wakeThe tender insects sleeping in their cells;Bright shines the Sun--and not a breeze to shakeThe drops that tip the melting icicles.\'O, enter now his temple gate!\'Inviting words--perchance already flung(As the crowd press devoutly down the aisleOf some old Minster\'s venerable pile)From voices into zealous passion stung,While the tubed engine feels the

banner of our joy we will erect,And strength of love our souls shall elevate:For to a few collected in his name,Their heavenly Father will incline an earGracious to service hallowed by its

voice; it said, \'Drink, pretty creature, drink!\'And, looking o\'er the hedge, before me I espiedA snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook. \'Drink, pretty creature, drink,\' she said in such a toneThat I almost received her heart into my own.\'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair.Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away:But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady placeI unobserved could see the workings of her face:If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing: \'What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord?Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;Rest, little young One, rest; what is\'t that aileth thee?\'What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!\'If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain; For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need\'st not fear,The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.\'Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the dayWhen my father found thee first in places far away;Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.\'He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yeanUpon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been. \'Thou know\'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this canFresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.\'Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,Then I\'ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is coldOur hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.\'It will not, will not rest!--Poor creature, can it beThat \'tis thy mother\'s heart which is working so in thee?

his boat and twinkling oar.My father was a good and pious man,An honest man, by honest parents bred,And I believe that, soon as I beganTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,And in his hearing there my prayers I said:And afterwards, by my good father taught,I read, and loved the books in which I read;For books in every neighboring house I sought,And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.Can I forget what charms did once adornMy garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme,And rose and lily for the sabbath morn?The sabbath bells, and the delightful chime;The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time;My hen\'s rich nest through long grass scarce espied;The cowslip-gathering at May\'s dewy prime;The swans, that when I sought the water-side,From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride.The staff I yet remember which upboreThe bending body of my active sire;His seat beneath the honeyed sycamoreWhen the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;When market-morning came, the neat attireWith which, though bent on haste, myself I deck\'d;My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire,When stranger passed, so often I have check\'d;The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck\'d.The suns of twenty summers danced along, -Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away:Then rose a mansion proud our woods among,And cottage after cottage owned its sway,No joy to see a neighboring house, or strayThrough pastures not his own, the master took;My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay;He loved his old hereditary nook,And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook.But, when he had refused the proffered gold,To cruel injuries he became a prey,Sore traversed in whate\'er he bought and sold:His troubles grew upon him day by day,Till all his substance fell into decay.His little range of water was denied;All but the bed where his old body lay,All, all was seized, and weeping, side by side,We sought a home where we uninjured might abide.Can I forget that miserable hour,When from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,Peering above the trees, the steeple tower,That on his marriage-day sweet music made?Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid,Close by my mother in their native bowers:Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed, \\\'f3 I could not pray: \\\'f3 through tears that fell in showers,Glimmer\'d our dear-loved home, alas!

Then peace to cruelty and scorn,While to the prison they are borne,Peace, peace to all indignity!\'And so in Prison were they laid--Oh hear me, hear me, gentle Maid,For I am come with power to bless,By scattering gleams, through your distress,Of a redeeming happiness.Me did a reverent pity moveAnd privilege of ancient love; And, in your service, making bold,Entrance I gained to that stronghold.Your Father gave me cordial greeting;But to his purposes, that burnedWithin him, instantly returned:He was commanding and entreating,And said--\'We need not stop, my Son!Thoughts press, and time is hurrying on\'--And so to Francis he renewedHis words, more calmly thus pursued. \'Might this our enterprise have sped,Change wide and deep the Land had seen,A renovation from the dead,A spring-tide of immortal green:The darksome altars would have blazedLike stars when clouds are rolled away;Salvation to all eyes that gazed,Once more the Rood had been upraisedTo spread its arms, and stand for aye.Then, then--had I survived to see New life in Bolton Priory;The voice restored, the eye of TruthRe-opened that inspired my youth;To see her in her pomp arrayed--This Banner (for such vow I made)Should on the consecrated breastOf that same Temple have found rest:I would myself have hung it high,Fit offering of glad victory!A shadow of such thought remains To cheer this sad and pensive time;A solemn fancy yet sustainsOne feeble Being--bids me climbEven to the last--one effort moreTo attest my Faith, if not restore.Hear then,\' said he, \'while I impart,My Son, the last wish of my heart.The Banner strive thou to regain;And, if the endeavour prove not vain,Bear it--to whom if not to thee Shall I this lonely thought consign?--Bear it to Bolton Priory,And lay it on Saint Mary\'s shrine;To wither in the sun and breeze\'Mid those decaying sanctities.There let at least the gift be laid,The testimony there displayed;Bold proof that with no selfish aim,But for lost Faith and Christ\'s dear name,I helmeted a brow though white, And took a place in all men\'s sight;Yea offered up this noble Brood,This fair unrivalled Brotherhood,And turned away from thee, my Son!And left--but be the rest unsaid,The name untouched, the tear unshed;--My wish is known, and I have done:Now promise, grant this one request,This dying prayer, and be thou blest!\'Then Francis answered--\'Trust thy Son, For, with God\'s will, it shall be done!\'--The pledge obtained, the solemn wordThus scarcely given, a noise was heard,And Officers appeared in stateTo lead the prisoners to their fate.They rose, oh! wherefore should I fearTo tell, or, Lady, you to hear?They rose--embraces none were given--They stood like trees when earth and heavenAre calm; they knew each other\'s worth, And reverently the Band went forth.They met, when they had reached the door,One with profane and harsh intentPlaced there--that he might go beforeAnd, with that rueful Banner borneAloft in sign of taunting scorn,Conduct them to their punishment:So cruel Sussex, unrestrainedBy human feeling, had ordained.The unhappy Banner Francis saw, And, with a look of calm commandInspiring universal awe,He took it from the soldier\'s hand;And all the people that stood roundConfirmed the deed in peace profound.--High transport did the Father shedUpon his Son--and they were led,Led on, and yielded up their breath;Together died, a happy death!--But Francis, soon as he had braved That insult, and the Banner saved,Athwart the unresisting tideOf the spectators occupiedIn admiration or dismay,Bore instantly his Charge away.\'These things, which thus had in the sightAnd hearing passed of Him who stoodWith Emily, on the Watch-tower height,In Rylstone\'s woeful neighbourhood,He told; and oftentimes with voice Of power to comfort or rejoice;For deepest sorrows that aspire,Go high, no transport ever higher.\'Yes--God is rich in mercy,\' saidThe old Man to the silent Maid,\'Yet, Lady! shines, through this black night,One star of aspect heavenly bright;Your Brother lives--he lives--is comePerhaps already to his home;Then let us leave this dreary place.\' She yielded, and with gentle pace,Though without one uplifted look,To Rylstone-hall her way she took.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM Bolton\'s old monastic towerThe bells ring loud with gladsome power;The sun shines bright; the fields are gayWith people in their best arrayOf stole and doublet, hood and scarf,Along the banks of crystal Wharf,Through the Vale retired and lowly,Trooping to that summons holy.And, up among the moorlands, seeWhat sprinklings of blithe company! Of lasses and of shepherd grooms,That down the steep hills force their way,Like cattle through the budded brooms;Path, or no path, what care they?And thus in joyous mood they hieTo Bolton\'s mouldering Priory.What would they there?--Full fifty yearsThat sumptuous Pile, with all its peers,Too harshly hath been doomed to tasteThe bitterness of wrong and waste: Its courts are ravaged; but the towerIs standing with a voice of power,That ancient voice which wont to callTo mass or some high festival;And in the shattered fabric\'s heartRemaineth one protected part;A Chapel, like a wild-bird\'s nest,Closely embowered and trimly drest;And thither young and old repair,This Sabbath-day, for praise and prayer. Fast the churchyard fills;--anonLook again, and they all are gone;The cluster round the porch, and the folkWho sate in the shade of the Prior\'s Oak!And scarcely have they disappearedEre the prelusive hymn is heard:--With one consent the people rejoice,Filling the church with a lofty voice!They sing a service which they feel:For \'tis the sunrise now of zeal; Of a pure faith the vernal prime--In great Eliza\'s golden time.A moment ends the fervent din,And all is hushed, without and within;For though the priest, more tranquilly,Recites the holy liturgy,The only voice which you can hearIs the river murmuring near.--When soft!--the dusky trees between,And down the path through the open green, Where is no living thing to be seen;And through yon gateway, where is found,Beneath the arch with ivy bound,Free entrance to the churchyard ground--Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,Comes gliding in serene and slow,Soft and silent as a dream,A solitary Doe!White she is as lily of June,And beauteous as the silver moon When out of sight the clouds are drivenAnd she is left alone in heaven;Or like a ship some gentle dayIn sunshine sailing far away,A glittering ship, that hath the plainOf ocean for her own domain.Lie silent in your graves, ye dead!Lie quiet in your churchyard bed!Ye living, tend your holy cares;Ye multitude, pursue your prayers; And blame not me if my heart and sightAre occupied with one delight!\'Tis a work for sabbath hoursIf I with this bright Creature go:Whether she be of forest bowers,From the bowers of earth below;Or a Spirit for one day given,A pledge of grace from purest heaven.What harmonious pensive changesWait upon her as she ranges Round and through this Pile of stateOverthrown and desolate!Now a step or two her wayLeads through space of open day,Where the enamoured sunny lightBrightens her that was so bright;Now doth a delicate shadow fall,Falls upon her like a breath,From some lofty arch or wall,As she passes underneath: Now some gloomy nook partakesOf the glory that she makes,--High-ribbed vault of stone, or cell,With perfect cunning framed as wellOf stone, and ivy, and the spreadOf the elder\'s bushy head;Some jealous and forbidding cell,That doth the living stars repel,And where no flower hath leave to dwell.The presence of this wandering Doe Fills many a damp obscure recessWith lustre of a saintly show;And, reappearing, she no lessSheds on the flowers that round her blowA more than sunny liveliness.But say, among these holy places,Which thus assiduously she paces,Comes she with a votary\'s task,Rite to perform, or boon to ask?Fair Pilgrim! harbours she a sense Of sorrow, or of reverence?Can she be grieved for quire or shrine,Crushed as if by wrath divine?For what survives of house where GodWas worshipped, or where Man abode;For old magnificence undone;Or for the gentler work begunBy Nature, softening and concealing,And busy with a hand of healing?Mourns she for lordly chamber\'s hearth That to the sapling ash gives birth;For dormitory\'s length laid bareWhere the wild rose blossoms fair;Or altar, whence the cross was rent,Now rich with mossy ornament?--She sees a warrior carved in stone,Among the thick weeds, stretched alone;A warrior, with his shield of prideCleaving humbly to his side,And hands in resignation prest, Palm to palm, on his tranquil breast;As little she regards the sightAs a common creature might:If she be doomed to inward care,Or service, it must lie elsewhere.--But hers are eyes serenely bright,And on she moves--with pace how light!Nor spares to stoop her head, and tasteThe dewy turf with flowers bestrown;And thus she fares, until at last Beside the ridge of a grassy graveIn quietness she lays her down;Gentle as a weary waveSinks, when the summer breeze hath died,Against an anchored vessel\'s side;Even so, without distress, doth sheLie down in peace, and lovingly.The day is placid in its going,To a lingering motion bound,Like the crystal stream now flowing With its softest summer sound:So the balmy minutes pass,While this radiant Creature liesCouched upon the dewy grass,Pensively with downcast eyes.--But now again the people raiseWith awful cheer a voice of praise;It is the last, the parting song;And from the temple forth they throng,And quickly spread themselves abroad, While each pursues his several road.But some--a variegated bandOf middle-aged, and old, and young,And little children by the handUpon their leading mothers hung--With mute obeisance gladly paidTurn towards the spot, where, full in view,The white Doe, to her service true,Her sabbath couch has made.It was a solitary mound; Which two spears\' length of level groundDid from all other graves divide:As if in some respect of pride;Or melancholy\'s sickly mood,Still shy of human neighbourhood;Or guilt, that humbly would expressA penitential loneliness.\'Look, there she is, my Child! draw near;She fears not, wherefore should we fear?She means no harm;\'--but still the Boy, To whom the words were softly said,Hung back, and smiled, and blushed for joy,A shame-faced blush of glowing red!Again the Mother whispered low,\'Now you have seen the famous Doe;From Rylstone she hath found her wayOver the hills this sabbath dayHer work, whate\'er it be, is done,And she will depart when we are gone;Thus doth she keep, from year to year, Her sabbath morning, foul or fair.\'Bright was the Creature, as in dreamsThe Boy had seen her, yea, more bright;But is she truly what she seems?He asks with insecure delight,Asks of himself, and doubts,--and stillThe doubt returns against his will:Though he, and all the standers-by,Could tell a tragic historyOf facts divulged, wherein appear Substantial motive, reason clear,Why thus the milk-white Doe is foundCouchant beside that lonely mound;And why she duly loves to paceThe circuit of this hallowed place.Nor to the Child\'s inquiring mindIs such perplexity confined:For, spite of sober Truth that seesA world of fixed remembrancesWhich to this mystery belong, If, undeceived, my skill can traceThe characters of every face,There lack not strange delusion here,Conjecture vague, and idle fear,And superstitious fancies strong,Which do the gentle Creature wrong.That bearded, staff-supported Sire--Who in his boyhood often fedFull cheerily on convent-breadAnd heard old tales by the convent-fire, And to his grave will go with scars,Relics of long and distant wars--That Old Man, studious to expoundThe spectacle, is mounting highTo days of dim antiquity;When Lady Aaliza mournedHer Son, and felt in her despairThe pang of unavailing prayer;Her Son in Wharf\'s abysses drowned,The noble Boy of Egremound. From which affliction--when the graceOf God had in her heart found place--A pious structure, fair to seeRose up, this stately Priory!The Lady\'s work;--but now laid low;To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustainA softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright; And glides o\'er the earth like an angel of light.Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;And, through the chink in the fractured floorLook down, and see a griesly sight;A vault where the bodies are buried upright!There, face by face, and hand by hand,The Claphams and Mauleverers stand;And, in his place, among son and sire,Is John de Clapham, that fierce Esquire,A valiant man, and a name of dread In the ruthless wars of the White and Red;Who dragged Earl Pembroke from Banbury churchAnd smote off his head on the stones of the porch!Look down among them, if you dare;Oft does the White Doe loiter there,Prying into the darksome rent;Nor can it be with good intent:So thinks that Dame of haughty air,Who hath a Page her book to hold,And wears a frontlet edged with gold. Harsh thoughts with her high mood agree--Who counts among her ancestryEarl Pembroke, slain so impiously!That slender Youth, a scholar pale,From Oxford come to his native vale,He also hath his own conceit:It is, thinks he, the gracious Fairy,Who loved the Shepherd-lord to meetIn his wanderings solitary:Wild notes she in his hearing sang, A song of Nature\'s hidden powers;That whistled like the wind, and rangAmong the rocks and holly bowers.\'Twas said that She all shapes could wear;And oftentimes before him stood,Amid the trees of some thick wood,In semblance of a lady fair;And taught him signs, and showed him sights,In Craven\'s dens, on Cumbrian heights;When under cloud of fear he lay, A shepherd clad in homely grey;Nor left him at his later day.And hence, when he, with spear and shield,Rode full of years to Flodden-field,His eye could see the hidden spring,And how the current was to flow;The fatal end of Scotland\'s King,And all that hopeless overthrow.But not in wars did he delight,\'This\' Clifford wished for worthier might; Nor in broad pomp, or courtly state;Him his own thoughts did elevate,--Most happy in the shy recessOf Barden\'s lowly quietness.And choice of studious friends had heOf Bolton\'s dear fraternity;Who, standing on this old church tower,In many a calm propitious hour,Perused, with him, the starry sky;Or, in their cells, with him did pry For other lore,--by keen desireUrged to close toil with chemic fire;In quest belike of transmutationsRich as the mine\'s most bright creations.But they and their good works are fled,And all is now disquieted--And peace is none, for living or dead!Ah, pensive Scholar, think not so,But look again at the radiant Doe!What quiet watch she seems to keep, Alone, beside that grassy heap!Why mention other thoughts unmeetFor vision so composed and sweet?While stand the people in a ring,Gazing, doubting, questioning;Yea, many overcome in spiteOf recollections clear and bright;Which yet do unto some impartAn undisturbed repose of heart.And all the assembly own a law Of orderly respect and awe;But see--they vanish one by one,And last, the Doe herself is gone.Harp! we have been full long beguiledBy vague thoughts, lured by fancies wild;To which, with no reluctant strings,Thou hast attuned thy murmurings;And now before this Pile we standIn solitude, and utter peace:But, Harp! thy murmurs may not cease-- A Spirit, with his angelic wings,In soft and breeze-like visitings,Has touched thee--and a Spirit\'s hand:A voice is with us--a commandTo chant, in strains of heavenly glory,A tale of tears, a mortal story!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto Seventh\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Powers there areThat touch each other to the quick--in modesWhich the gross world no sense hath to perceive,No soul to dream of.\'THOU Spirit, whose angelic handWas to the harp a strong command,Called the submissive strings to wakeIn glory for this Maiden\'s sake,Say, Spirit! whither hath she fledTo hide her poor afflicted head?What mighty forest in its gloomEnfolds her?--is a rifted tombWithin the wilderness her seat?Some island which the wild waves beat-- Is that the Sufferer\'s last retreat?Or some aspiring rock, that shroudsIts perilous front in mists and clouds?High-climbing rock, low sunless dale,Sea, desert, what do these avail?Oh take her anguish and her fearsInto a deep recess of years!\'Tis done;--despoil and desolationO\'er Rylstone\'s fair domain have blown;Pools, terraces, and walks are sown With weeds; the bowers are overthrown,Or have given way to slow mutation,While, in their ancient habitationThe Norton name hath been unknown.The lordly Mansion of its prideIs stripped; the ravage hath spread wideThrough park and field, a perishingThat mocks the gladness of the Spring!And, with this silent gloom agreeing,Appears a joyless human Being, Of aspect such as if the wasteWere under her dominion placed.Upon a primrose bank, her throneOf quietness, she sits alone;Among the ruins of a wood,Erewhile a covert bright and green,And where full many a brave tree stood,That used to spread its boughs, and ringWith the sweet bird\'s carolling.Behold her, like a virgin Queen, Neglecting in imperial stateThese outward images of fate,And carrying inward a sereneAnd perfect sway, through many a thoughtOf chance and change, that hath been broughtTo the subjection of a holy,Though stern and rigorous, melancholy!The like authority, with graceOf awfulness, is in her face,--There hath she fixed it; yet it seems To o\'ershadow by no native rightThat face, which cannot lose the gleams,Lose utterly the tender gleams,Of gentleness and meek delight,And loving-kindness ever bright:Such is her sovereign mien:--her dress(A vest with woollen cincture tied,A hood of mountain-wool undyed)Is homely,--fashioned to expressA wandering Pilgrim\'s humbleness. And she \'hath\' wandered, long and far,Beneath the light of sun and star;Hath roamed in trouble and in grief,Driven forward like a withered leaf,Yea like a ship at random blownTo distant places and unknown.But now she dares to seek a havenAmong her native wilds of Craven;Hath seen again her Father\'s roof,And put her fortitude to proof; The mighty sorrow hath been borne,And she is thoroughly forlorn:Her soul doth in itself stand fast,Sustained by memory of the pastAnd strength of Reason; held aboveThe infirmities of mortal love;Undaunted, lofty, calm, and stable,And awfully impenetrable.And so--beneath a mouldered tree,A self-surviving leafless oak By unregarded age from strokeOf ravage saved--sate Emily.There did she rest, with head reclined,Herself most like a stately flower,(Such have I seen) whom chance of birthHath separated from its kind,To live and die in a shady bower,Single on the gladsome earth.When, with a noise like distant thunder,A troop of deer came sweeping by; And, suddenly, behold a wonder!For One, among those rushing deer,A single One, in mid careerHath stopped, and fixed her large full eyeUpon the Lady Emily;A Doe most beautiful, clear-white,A radiant creature, silver-bright!Thus checked, a little while it stayed;A little thoughtful pause it made;And then advanced with stealth-like pace, Drew softly near her, and more near--Looked round--but saw no cause for fear;So to her feet the Creature came,And laid its head upon her knee,And looked into the Lady\'s face,A look of pure benignity,And fond unclouded memory.It is, thought Emily, the same,The very Doe of other years!--The pleading look the Lady viewed, And, by her gushing thoughts subdued,She melted into tears--A flood of tears, that flowed apace,Upon the happy Creature\'s face.Oh, moment ever blest! O PairBeloved of Heaven, Heaven\'s chosen care,This was for you a precious greeting;And may it prove a fruitful meeting!Joined are they, and the sylvan DoeCan she depart? can she forego The Lady, once her playful peer,And now her sainted Mistress dear?And will not Emily receiveThis lovely chronicler of thingsLong past, delights and sorrowings?Lone Sufferer! will not she believeThe promise in that speaking face;And welcome, as a gift of grace,The saddest thought the Creature brings?That day, the first of a re-union Which was to teem with high communion,That day of balmy April weather,They tarried in the wood together.And when, ere fall of evening dew,She from her sylvan haunt withdrew,The White Doe tracked with faithful paceThe Lady to her dwelling-place;That nook where, on paternal ground,A habitation she had found,The Master of whose humble board Once owned her Father for his Lord;A hut, by tufted trees defended,Where Rylstone brook with Wharf is blended.When Emily by morning lightWent forth, the Doe stood there in sight.She shrunk:--with one frail shock of painReceived and followed by a prayer,She saw the Creature once again;Shun will she not, she feels, will bear;--But, wheresoever she looked round, All now was trouble-haunted ground;And therefore now she deems it goodOnce more this restless neighbourhoodTo leave.--Unwooed, yet unforbidden,The White Doe followed up the vale,Up to another cottage, hiddenIn the deep fork of Amerdale;And there may Emily restoreHerself, in spots unseen before.--Why tell of mossy rock, or tree, By lurking Dernbrook\'s pathless side,Haunts of a strengthening amityThat calmed her, cheered, and fortified?For she hath ventured now to readOf time, and place, and thought, and deed--Endless history that liesIn her silent Follower\'s eyes;Who with a power like human reasonDiscerns the favourable season,Skilled to approach or to retire,-- From looks conceiving her desire;From look, deportment, voice, or mien,That vary to the heart within.If she too passionately wreathedHer arms, or over-deeply breathed,Walked quick or slowly, every moodIn its degree was understood;Then well may their accord be true,And kindliest intercourse ensue.--Oh! surely \'twas a gentle rousing When she by sudden glimpse espiedThe White Doe on the mountain browsing,Or in the meadow wandered wide!How pleased, when down the Straggler sankBeside her, on some sunny bank!How soothed, when in thick bower enclosed,They, like a nested pair, reposed!Fair Vision! when it crossed the MaidWithin some rocky cavern laid,The dark cave\'s portal gliding by, White as whitest cloud on highFloating through the azure sky.--What now is left for pain or fear?That Presence, dearer and more dear,While they, side by side, were straying,And the shepherd\'s pipe was playing,Did now a very gladness yieldAt morning to the dewy field,And with a deeper peace enduedThe hour of moonlight solitude. With her Companion, in such frameOf mind, to Rylstone back she came;And, ranging through the wasted groves,Received the memory of old loves,Undisturbed and undistrest,Into a soul which now was blestWith a soft spring-day of holy,Mild, and grateful, melancholy:Not sunless gloom or unenlightened,But by tender fancies brightened. When the bells of Rylstone playedTheir sabbath music--\'God us ayde!\'That was the sound they seemed to speak;Inscriptive legend which I weenMay on those holy bells be seen,That legend and her Grandsire\'s name;And oftentimes the Lady meekHad in her childhood read the same;Words which she slighted at that day;But now, when such sad change was wrought, And of that lonely name she thought--The bells of Rylstone seemed to say,While she sate listening in the shade,With vocal music, \'God us ayde;\'And all the hills were glad to bearTheir part in this effectual prayer.Nor lacked she Reason\'s firmest power;But with the White Doe at her sideUp would she climb to Norton Tower,And thence look round her far and wide, Her fate there measuring;--all is stilled,--The weak One hath subdued her heart;Behold the prophecy fulfilled,Fulfilled, and she sustains her part!But here her Brother\'s words have failed;Here hath a milder doom prevailed;That she, of him and all bereft,Hath yet this faithful Partner left;This one Associate, that disprovesHis words, remains for her, and loves. If tears are shed, they do not fallFor loss of him--for one, or all;Yet, sometimes, sometimes doth she weepMoved gently in her soul\'s soft sleep;A few tears down her cheek descendFor this her last and living Friend.Bless, tender Hearts, their mutual lot,And bless for both this savage spot;Which Emily doth sacred holdFor reasons dear and manifold-- Here hath she, here before her sight,Close to the summit of this height,The grassy rock-encircled PoundIn which the Creature first was found.So beautiful the timid Thrall(A spotless Youngling white as foam)Her youngest Brother brought it home;The youngest, then a lusty boy,Bore it, or led, to Rylstone-hallWith heart brimful of pride and joy! But most to Bolton\'s sacred Pile,On favouring nights, she loved to go;There ranged through cloister, court, and aisle,Attended by the soft-paced Doe;Nor feared she in the still moonshineTo look upon Saint Mary\'s shrine;Nor on the lonely turf that showedWhere Francis slept in his last abode.For that she came; there oft she sateForlorn, but not disconsolate: And, when she from the abyss returnedOf thought, she neither shrunk nor mourned;Was happy that she lived to greetHer mute Companion as it layIn love and pity at her feet;How happy in its turn to meetThe recognition! the mild glanceBeamed from that gracious countenance;Communication, like the rayOf a new morning, to the nature And prospects of the inferior Creature!A mortal Song we sing, by dowerEncouraged of celestial power;Power which the viewless Spirit shedBy whom we were first visited;Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wingsSwept like a breeze the conscious strings,When, left in solitude, erewhileWe stood before this ruined Pile,And, quitting unsubstantial dreams, Sang in this Presence kindred themes;Distress and desolation spreadThrough human hearts, and pleasure dead,--Dead--but to live again on earth,A second and yet nobler birth;Dire overthrow, and yet how highThe re-ascent in sanctity!From fair to fairer; day by dayA more divine and loftier way!Even such this blessed Pilgrim trod, By sorrow lifted towards her God;Uplifted to the purest skyOf undisturbed mortality.Her own thoughts loved she; and could bendA dear look to her lowly Friend;There stopped; her thirst was satisfiedWith what this innocent spring supplied:Her sanction inwardly she bore,And stood apart from human cares:But to the world returned no more, Although with no unwilling mindHelp did she give at need, and joinedThe Wharfdale peasants in their prayers.At length, thus faintly, faintly tiedTo earth, she was set free, and died.Thy soul, exalted Emily,Maid of the blasted family,Rose to the God from whom it came!--In Rylstone Church her mortal frameWas buried by her Mother\'s side. Most glorious sunset! and a raySurvives--the twilight of this day--In that fair Creature whom the fieldsSupport, and whom the forest shields;Who, having filled a holy place,Partakes, in her degree, Heaven\'s grace;And bears a memory and a mindRaised far above the law of kind;Haunting the spots with lonely cheerWhich her dear Mistress once held dear: Loves most what Emily loved most--The enclosure of this churchyard ground;Here wanders like a gliding ghost,And every sabbath here is found;Comes with the people when the bellsAre heard among the moorland dells,Finds entrance through yon arch, where wayLies open on the sabbath-day;Here walks amid the mournful wasteOf prostrate altars, shrines defaced, And floors encumbered with rich showOf fret-work imagery laid low;Paces softly, or makes halt,By fractured cell, or tomb, or vault;By plate of monumental brassDim-gleaming among weeds and grass,And sculptured Forms of Warriors brave:But chiefly by that single grave,That one sequestered hillock green,The pensive visitant is seen. There doth the gentle Creature lieWith those adversities unmoved;Calm spectacle, by earth and skyIn their benignity approved!And aye, methinks, this hoary Pile,Subdued by outrage and decay,Looks down upon her with a smile,A gracious smile, that seems to say--\'Thou, thou art not a Child of Time,But Daughter of the Eternal Prime!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Recluse  -  Book First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHOME AT GRASMEREONCE to the verge of yon steep barrier cameA roving school-boy; what the adventurer\'s ageHath now escaped his memory--but the hour,One of a golden summer holiday,He well remembers, though the year be gone--Alone and devious from afar he came;And, with a sudden influx overpoweredAt sight of this seclusion, he forgotHis haste, for hasty had his footsteps beenAs boyish his pursuits; and sighing said, \'What happy fortune were it here to live!And, if a thought of dying, if a thoughtOf mortal separation, could intrudeWith paradise before him, here to die!\'No Prophet was he, had not even a hope,Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,A fancy in the heart of what might beThe lot of others, never could be his.The station whence he looked was soft and green,Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth Of vale below, a height of hills above.For rest of body perfect was the spot,All that luxurious nature could desire;But stirring to the spirit; who could gazeAnd not feel motions there? He thought of cloudsThat sail on winds: of breezes that delightTo play on water, or in endless chasePursue each other through the yielding plainOf grass or corn, over and through and through,In billow after billow, evermore Disporting--nor unmindful was the boyOf sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds;Of fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays,Genii, and winged angels that are LordsWithout restraint of all which they behold.The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he feltThat such unfettered liberty was his,Such power and joy; but only for this end,To flit from field to rock, from rock to field,From shore to island, and from isle to shore, From open ground to covert, from a bedOf meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood;From high to low, from low to high, yet stillWithin the bound of this huge concave; hereMust be his home, this valley be his world.Since that day forth the Place to him--\'to me\'(For I who live to register the truthWas that same young and happy Being) becameAs beautiful to thought, as it had beenWhen present, to the bodily sense; a haunt Of pure affections, shedding upon joyA brighter joy; and through such damp and gloomOf the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youthMistakes for sorrow, darting beams of lightThat no self-cherished sadness could withstand;And now \'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,Beloved Grasmere (let the wandering streamsTake up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name)One of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home.And was the cost so great? and could it seem An act of courage, and the thing itselfA conquest? who must bear the blame? Sage manThy prudence, thy experience, thy desires,Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.Yes the realities of life so cold,So cowardly, so ready to betray,So stinted in the measure of their graceAs we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,Have been to me more bountiful than hope,Less timid than desire--but that is past. On Nature\'s invitation do I come,By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead,That made the calmest fairest spot of earthWith all its unappropriated goodMy own; and not mine only, for with meEntrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,A younger Orphan of a home extinct,The only Daughter of my Parents dwells.Ay, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir, Pause upon that and let the breathing frameNo longer breathe, but all be satisfied.--Oh, if such silence be not thanks to GodFor what hath been bestowed, then where, where thenShall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne\'erFix on a lovely object, nor my mindTake pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,But either She whom now I have, who nowDivides with me this loved abode, was there,Or not far off. Where\'er my footsteps turned, Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,The thought of her was like a flash of light,Or an unseen companionship, a breathOf fragrance independent of the Wind.In all my goings, in the new and oldOf all my meditations, and in thisFavourite of all, in this the most of all.--What being, therefore, since the birth of ManHad ever more abundant cause to speakThanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse Make him more thankful, then to call on VerseTo aid him and in song resound his joy?The boon is absolute; surpassing graceTo me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowersOf blissful Eden this was neither givenNor could be given, possession of the goodWhich had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,And dear Imaginations realised,Up to their highest measure, yea and more.Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in; Now in the clear and open day I feelYour guardianship; I take it to my heart;\'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.But I would call thee beautiful, for mild,And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou artDear Valley, having in thy face a smileThough peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,Pleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake,Its one green island and its winding shores;The multitude of little rocky hills, Thy Church and cottages of mountain stoneClustered like stars some few, but single most,And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,Or glancing at each other cheerful looksLike separated stars with clouds between.What want we? have we not perpetual streams,Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,And thickets full of songsters, and the voiceOf lordly birds, an unexpected sound Heard now and then from morn to latest eve,Admonishing the man who walks belowOf solitude and silence in the sky?These have we, and a thousand nooks of earthHave also these, but nowhere else is found,Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be foundThe one sensation that is here; \'tis here,Here as it found its way into my heartIn childhood, here as it abides by day,By night, here only; or in chosen minds That take it with them hence, where\'er they go.--\'Tis, but I cannot name it, \'tis the senseOf majesty, and beauty, and repose,A blended holiness of earth and sky,Something that makes this individual spot,This small abiding-place of many men,A termination, and a last retreat,A centre, come from wheresoe\'er you will,A whole without dependence or defect,Made for itself, and happy in itself, Perfect contentment, Unity entire.Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,When hitherward we journeyed side by sideThrough burst of sunshine and through flying showers;Paced the long vales--how long they were--and yetHow fast that length of way was left behind,Wensley\'s rich Vale, and Sedbergh\'s naked heights.The frosty wind, as if to make amendsFor its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,And drove us onward like two ships at sea, Or like two birds, companions in mid-air,Parted and reunited by the blast.Stern was the face of nature; we rejoicedIn that stern countenance, for our souls thence drewA feeling of their strength. The naked trees,The icy brooks, as on we passed, appearedTo question us. \'Whence come ye, to what end?\'They seemed to say, \'What would ye,\' said the shower,\'Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?\'The sunbeam said, \'Be happy.\' When this vale We entered, bright and solemn was the skyThat faced us with a passionate welcoming,And led us to our threshold. Daylight failedInsensibly, and round us gently fellComposing darkness, with a quiet loadOf full contentment, in a little shedDisturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,And wondering at its new inhabitants.It loves us now, this Vale so beautifulBegins to love us! by a sullen storm, Two months unwearied of severest storm,It put the temper of our minds to proof,And found us faithful through the gloom, and heardThe poet mutter his prelusive songsWith cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joyAmong the silence of the woods and hills;Silent to any gladsomeness of soundWith all their shepherds.But the gates of SpringAre opened; churlish winter hath given leaveThat she should entertain for this one day, Perhaps for many genial days to come,His guests, and make them jocund.--They are pleased,But most of all the birds that haunt the floodWith the mild summons; inmates though they beOf Winter\'s household, they keep festivalThis day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;They show their pleasure, and shall I do less?Happier of happy though I be, like themI cannot take possession of the sky,Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there One of a mighty multitude, whose wayIs a perpetual harmony and danceMagnificent. Behold how with a graceOf ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seemInferior to angelical, they prolongTheir curious pastime, shaping in mid-air,And sometimes with ambitious wing that soarsHigh as the level of the mountain tops,A circuit ampler than the lake beneath,Their own domain;--but ever, while intent On tracing and retracing that large round,Their jubilant activity evolvesHundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,Upwards and downwards; progress intricateYet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayedTheir indefatigable flight. \'Tis done,Ten times and more I fancied it had ceased,But lo! the vanished company againAscending, they approach. I hear their wingsFaint, faint at first; and then an eager sound Passed in a moment--and as faint again!They tempt the sun to sport among their plumes;Tempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice,To show them a fair image,--\'tis themselves,Their own fair forms upon the glimmering plainPainted more soft and fair as they descend,Almost to touch,--then up again aloft,Up with a sally and a flash of speed,As if they scorned both resting-place and rest!--This day is a thanksgiving, \'tis a day Of glad emotion and deep quietness;Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,The penetrating bliss; oh surely theseHave felt it, not the happy choirs of spring,Her own peculiar family of loveThat sport among green leaves, a blither train!But two are missing, two, a lonely pairOf milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seenPartaking this day\'s pleasure? From afar They came, to sojourn here in solitude,Choosing this Valley, they who had the choiceOf the whole world. We saw them day by day,Through those two months of unrelenting storm,Conspicuous at the centre of the LakeTheir safe retreat, we knew them well, I guessThat the whole valley knew them; but to usThey were more dear than may be well believed,Not only for their beauty, and their stillAnd placid way of life, and constant love Inseparable, not for these alone,But that \'their\' state so much resembled ours,They having also chosen this abode;They strangers, and we strangers, they a pair,And we a solitary pair like them.They should not have departed; many daysDid I look forth in vain, nor on the wingCould see them, nor in that small open spaceOf blue unfrozen water, where they lodgedAnd lived so long in quiet, side by side. Shall we behold them consecrated friends,Faithful companions, yet another yearSurviving, they for us, and we for them,And neither pair be broken? nay perchanceIt is too late already for such hope;The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,And parted them; or haply both are goneOne death, and that were mercy given to both.Recall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive,Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh Of such inhospitable penaltyInflicted upon confidence so pure.Ah! if I wished to follow where the sightOf all that is before my eyes, the voiceWhich speaks from a presiding spirit here,Would lead me, I should whisper to myself:They who are dwellers in this holy placeMust needs themselves be hallowed, they requireNo benediction from the stranger\'s lips,For they are blessed already; none would give The greeting \'peace be with you\' unto them,For peace they have; it cannot but be theirs,And mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these--\'Their\' healing offices a pure good-willPrecludes, and charity beyond the boundsOf charity--an overflowing love;Not for the creature only, but for allThat is around them; love for everythingWhich in their happy Region they behold!Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought Is passed, we blame it not for having come.--What if I floated down a pleasant stream,And now am landed, and the motion gone,Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the streamIs flowing, and will never cease to flow,And I shall float upon that stream again.By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,Words cannot say how beautiful: then hail,Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,Delightful Valley, habitation fair! And to whatever else of outward formCan give an inward help, can purify,And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,And steal away, and for a while deceiveAnd lap in pleasing rest, and bear us onWithout desire in full complacency,Contemplating perfection absolute,And entertained as in a placid sleep.But not betrayed by tenderness of mindThat feared, or wholly overlooked the truth, Did we come hither, with romantic hopeTo find in midst of so much lovelinessLove, perfect love: of so much majestyA like majestic-frame of mind in thoseWho here abide, the persons like the place.Not from such hope, or aught of such belief,Hath issued any portion of the joyWhich I have felt this day. An awful voice\'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard,Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields, Shout after shout--reiterated whoop,In manner of a bird that takes delightIn answering to itself: or like a houndSingle at chase among the lonely woods,His yell repeating; yet it was in truthA human voice--a spirit of coming night;How solemn when the sky is dark, and earthNot dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snowMade visible, amid a noise of windsAnd bleatings manifold of mountain sheep, Which in that iteration recogniseTheir summons, and are gathering round for food,Devoured with keenness, ere to grove or bankOr rocky bield with patience they retire.That very voice, which, in some timid moodOf superstitious fancy, might have seemedAwful as ever stray demoniac uttered,His steps to govern in the wilderness;Or as the Norman Curfew\'s regular beatTo hearths when first they darkened at the knell: That shepherd\'s voice, it may have reached mine earDebased and under profanation, madeThe ready organ of articulate soundsFrom ribaldry, impiety, or wrath,Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawlsOf some abused Festivity--so be it.I came not dreaming of unruffled life,Untainted manners; born among the hills,Bred also there, I wanted not a scaleTo regulate my hopes; pleased with the good I shrink not from the evil with disgust,Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man,The common creature of the brotherhood,Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,For selfishness and envy and revenge,Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.Yet is it something gained, it is in truthA mighty gain, that Labour here preservesHis rosy face, a servant only here Of the fireside or of the open field,A Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired:That extreme penury is here unknown,And cold and hunger\'s abject wretchednessMortal to body and the heaven-born mind:That they who want are not too great a weightFor those who can relieve; here may the heartBreathe in the air of fellow-sufferingDreadless, as in a kind of fresher breezeOf her own native element, the hand Be ready and unwearied without plea,From tasks too frequent or beyond its power,For languor or indifference or despair.And as these lofty barriers break the forceOf winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in partConceal us from the storm, so here abidesA power and a protection for the mind,Dispensed indeed to other solitudesFavoured by noble privilege like this,Where kindred independence of estate Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,He, happy man! is master of the field,And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod.Not less than halfway up yon mountain\'s side,Behold a dusky spot, a grove of FirsThat seems still smaller than it is; this groveIs haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spiritOf memory faithful to the call of love;For, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends upYon curling smoke from the grey cot below, The trees (her first-born child being then a babe)Were planted by her husband and herself,That ranging o\'er the high and houseless groundTheir sheep might neither want from perilous stormOf winter, nor from summer\'s sultry heat,A friendly covert; \'and they knew it well,\'Said she, \'for thither as the trees grew upWe to the patient creatures carried foodIn times of heavy snow.\' She then beganIn fond obedience to her private thoughts To speak of her dead husband; is there notAn art, a music, and a strain of wordsThat shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life,Shall speak of what is done among the fields,Done truly there, or felt, of solid goodAnd real evil, yet be sweet withal,More grateful, more harmonious than the breath,The idle breath of softest pipe attunedTo pastoral fancies? Is there such a streamPure and unsullied flowing from the heart With motions of true dignity and grace?Or must we seek that stream where Man is not?Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,Delicious as the gentlest breeze that soundsThrough that aerial fir-grove--could preserveSome portion of its human historyAs gathered from the Matron\'s lips, and tellOf tears that have been shed at sight of it,And moving dialogues between this PairWho in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while theyNo longer flourish, he entirely gone,She withering in her loneliness. Be thisA task above my skill--the silent mindHas her own treasures, and I think of these,Love what I see, and honour humankind.No, we are not alone, we do not stand,My sister here misplaced and desolate,Loving what no one cares for but ourselves,We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks Of this fair Vale, and o\'er its spacious heights,Unprofitable kindliness, bestowedOn objects unaccustomed to the giftsOf feeling, which were cheerless and forlornBut few weeks past, and would be so againWere we not here; we do not tend a lampWhose lustre we alone participate,Which shines dependent upon us alone,Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.Look where we will, some human hand has been Before us with its offering; not a treeSprinkles these little pastures, but the sameHath furnished matter for a thought; perchanceFor some one serves as a familiar friend.Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,Home of untutored shepherds as it is,Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deemThese feelings, though subservient more than oursTo every day\'s demand for daily bread, And borrowing more their spirit and their shapeFrom self-respecting interests; deem them notUnworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no,They lift the animal being, do themselvesBy nature\'s kind and ever-present aidRefine the selfishness from which they spring,Redeem by love the individual senseOf anxiousness, with which they are combined.And thus it is that fitly they becomeAssociates in the joy of purest minds: They blend therewith congenially: meanwhileCalmly they breathe their own undying lifeThrough this their mountain sanctuary; longOh long may it remain inviolate,Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,And giving to the moments as they passTheir little boons of animating thoughtThat sweeten labour, make it seen and feltTo be no arbitrary weight imposed,But a glad function natural to man. Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,Already have I gained; the inward frame,Though slowly opening, opens every dayWith process not unlike to that which cheersA pensive stranger journeying at his leisureThrough some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mistsBreak up and are beginning to recede;How pleased he is where thin and thinner growsThe veil, or where it parts at once, to spyThe dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads; To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed;Then to be greeted by the scattered hutsAs they shine out; and \'see\' the streams whose murmurHad soothed his ear while \'they\' were hidden; how pleasedTo have about him which way e\'er he goesSomething on every side concealed from view,In every quarter something visibleHalf seen or wholly, lost and found again,Alternate progress and impediment,And yet a growing prospect in the main. Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,Herein less happy than the Traveller,To cast from time to time a painful lookUpon unwelcome things which unawaresReveal themselves, not therefore is my heartDepressed, nor does it fear what is to come;But confident, enriched at every glance,The more I see the more delight my mindReceives, or by reflection can create:Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?Nor let me pass unheeded other lovesWhere no fear is, and humbler sympathies.Already hath sprung up within my heartA liking for the small grey horse that bearsThe paralytic man, and for the bruteIn Scripture sanctified--the patient bruteOn which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.The famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale, Though yet to me a stranger, will not beA stranger long; nor will the blind man\'s guide,Meek and neglected thing, of no renown!Soon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fadesFriends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrushTo rouse me, and a hundred warblers more!And if those Eagles to their ancient holdReturn, Helvellyn\'s Eagles! with the PairFrom my own door I shall be free to claimAcquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud. The owl that gives the name to Owlet-CragHave I heard whooping, and he soon will beA chosen one of my regards. See thereThe heifer in yon little croft belongsTo one who holds it dear; with duteous careShe reared it, and in speaking of her chargeI heard her scatter some endearing wordsDomestic, and in spirit motherly,She being herself a mother; happy Beast,If the caresses of a human voice Can make it so, and care of human hands.And ye as happy under Nature\'s care,Strangers to me and all men, or at leastStrangers to all particular amity,All intercourse of knowledge or of loveThat parts the individual from his kind.Whether in large communities ye keepFrom year to year, not shunning man\'s abode,A settled residence, or be from farWild creatures, and of many homes, that come The gift of winds, and whom the winds againTake from us at your pleasure; yet shall yeNot want for this your own subordinate placeIn my affections. Witness the delightWith which erewhile I saw that multitudeWheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,Yet not at rest upon the glassy lake:They \'cannot\' rest--they gambol like young whelps;Active as lambs, and overcome with joyThey try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge, And beat the passive water with their wings.Too distant are they for plain view, but lo!Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun,Betray their occupation, rising upFirst one and then another silver spout,As one or other takes the fit of glee,Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guiseOf plaything fireworks, that on festal nightsSparkle about the feet of wanton boys.--How vast the compass of this theatre, Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pompAnd silent majesty; the birch-tree woodsAre hung with thousand thousand diamond dropsOf melted hoar-frost, every tiny knotIn the bare twigs, each little budding-placeCased with its several beads; what myriads theseUpon one tree, while all the distant grove,That rises to the summit of the steep,Shows like a mountain built of silver light:See yonder the same pageant, and again Behold the universal imageryInverted, all its sun-bright features touchedAs with the varnish and the gloss of dreams.Dreamlike the blending also of the wholeHarmonious landscape: all along the shoreThe boundary lost--the line invisibleThat parts the image from reality;And the clear hills, as high as they ascendHeavenward, so deep piercing the lake below.Admonished of the days of love to come The raven croaks, and fills the upper airWith a strange sound of genial harmony;And in and all about that playful band,Incapable although they be of rest,And in their fashion very rioters,There is a stillness, and they seem to makeCalm revelry in that their calm abode.Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass,Pass with a thought the life of the whole yearThat is to come: the throng of woodland flowers And lilies that will dance upon the waves.Say boldly then that solitude is notWhere these things are: he truly is alone,He of the multitude whose eyes are doomedTo hold a vacant commerce day by dayWith Objects wanting life--repelling love;He by the vast metropolis immured,Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls,Where numbers overwhelm humanity,And neighbourhood serves rather to divide Than to unite--what sighs more deep than his,Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;Who must inhabit under a black skyA city, where, if indifference to disgustYield not to scorn or sorrow, living menAre ofttimes to their fellow-men no moreThan to the forest Hermit are the leavesThat hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less,For they protect his walk from sun and shower,Swell his devotion with their voice in storms, And whisper while the stars twinkle among themHis lullaby. From crowded streets remote,Far from the living and dead WildernessOf the thronged world, Society is hereA true community--a genuine frameOf many into one incorporate.\'That\' must be looked for here: paternal sway,One household, under God, for high and low,One family and one mansion; to themselvesAppropriate, and divided from the world, As if it were a cave, a multitudeHuman and brute, possessors undisturbedOf this Recess--their legislative Hall,Their Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place.Dismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams,All golden fancies of the golden age,The bright array of shadowy thoughts from timesThat were before all time, or are to beEre time expire, the pageantry that stirsOr will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed On lovely objects, and we wish to partWith all remembrance of a jarring world,--Take we at once this one sufficient hope,What need of more? that we shall neither droopNor pine for want of pleasure in the lifeScattered about us, nor through want of aughtThat keeps in health the insatiable mind.--That we shall have for knowledge and for loveAbundance, and that feeling as we doHow goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure From all reproach is yon ethereal vault,And this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart,By which and under which we are enclosedTo breathe in peace; we shall moreover find(If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,If rightly we observe and justly weigh)The inmates not unworthy of their home,The Dwellers of their Dwelling.And if thisWere otherwise, we have within ourselvesEnough to fill the present day with joy, And overspread the future years with hope,Our beautiful and quiet home, enrichedAlready with a stranger whom we loveDeeply, a stranger of our Father\'s house,A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,Who finds at last an hour to his contentBeneath our roof. And others whom we loveWill seek us also, Sisters of our hearts,And one, like them, a Brother of our hearts,Philosopher and Poet, in whose sight These mountains will rejoice with open joy.--Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we areAnd must be, with God\'s will, a happy Band.Yet \'tis not to enjoy that we exist,For that end only; something must be done:I must not walk in unreproved delightThese narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,No duty that looks further, and no care.Each Being has his office, lowly someAnd common, yet all worthy if fulfilled With zeal, acknowledgment that with the giftKeeps pace a harvest answering to the seed.Of ill-advised Ambition and of PrideI would stand clear, but yet to me I feelThat an internal brightness is vouchsafedThat must not die, that must not pass away.Why does this inward lustre fondly seekAnd gladly blend with outward fellowship?Why do \'they\' shine around me whom I love?Why do they teach me, whom I thus revere? Strange question, yet it answers not itself.That humble Roof embowered among the trees,That calm fireside, it is not even in them,Blest as they are, to furnish a replyThat satisfies and ends in perfect rest.Possessions have I that are solely mine,Something within which yet is shared by none,Not even the nearest to me and most dear,Something which power and effort may impart;I would impart it, I would spread it wide: Immortal in the world which is to come--Forgive me if I add another claim--And would not wholly perish even in this,Lie down and be forgotten in the dust,I and the modest Partners of my daysMaking a silent company in death;Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights,All buried with me without monumentOr profit unto any but ourselves!It must not be, if I, divinely taught, Be privileged to speak as I have feltOf what in man is human or divine.While yet an innocent little one, with a heartThat doubtless wanted not its tender moods,I breathed (for this I better recollect)Among wild appetites and blind desires,Motions of savage instinct my delightAnd exaltation. Nothing at that timeSo welcome, no temptation half so dearAs that which urged me to a daring feat, Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,And tottering towers: I loved to stand and readTheir looks forbidding, read and disobey,Sometimes in act and evermore in thought.With impulses, that scarcely were by theseSurpassed in strength, I heard of danger metOr sought with courage; enterprise forlornBy one, sole keeper of his own intent,Or by a resolute few, who for the sakeOf glory fronted multitudes in arms. Yea, to this hour I cannot read a TaleOf two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,And fighting to the death, but I am pleasedMore than a wise man ought to be; I wish,Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there.But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seekFor other agitations, or be calm;Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,Some nursling of the mountains which she leadsThrough quiet meadows, after he has learnt His strength, and had his triumph and his joy,His desperate course of tumult and of glee.That which in stealth by Nature was performedHath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate VoiceHath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things,Thy glory and thy happiness be there.Nor fear, though thou confide in me, a wantOf aspirations that have been--of foesTo wrestle with, and victory to complete,Bounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored; All that inflamed thy infant heart, the love,The longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest,All shall survive, though changed their office, allShall live, it is not in their power to die.Then farewell to the Warrior\'s Schemes, farewellThe forwardness of soul which looks that wayUpon a less incitement than the CauseOf Liberty endangered, and farewellThat other hope, long mine, the hope to fillThe heroic trumpet with the Muse\'s breath! Yet in this peaceful Vale we will not spendUnheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought,A voice shall speak, and what will be the theme?On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life,Musing in solitude, I oft perceiveFair trains of imagery before me rise,Accompanied by feelings of delightPure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed;And I am conscious of affecting thoughtsAnd dear remembrances, whose presence soothes Or elevates the Mind, intent to weighThe good and evil of our mortal state.--To these emotions, whencesoe\'er they come,Whether from breath of outward circumstance,Or from the Soul--an impulse to herself--I would give utterance in numerous verse.Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope,And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith;Of blessed consolations in distress;Of moral strength, and intellectual Power; Of joy in widest commonalty spread;Of the individual Mind that keeps her ownInviolate retirement, subject thereTo Conscience only, and the law supremeOf that Intelligence which governs all--I sing:--\'fit audience let me find though few!\'So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--In holiest mood. Urania, I shall needThy guidance, or a greater Muse, if suchDescend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!

For all--all dying in one hour!--Why comes not Francis? Thoughts of loveShould bear him to his Sister dearWith the fleet motion of a dove;Yea, like a heavenly messengerOf speediest wing, should he appear.Why comes he not?--for westward fastAlong the plain of York he past;Reckless of what impels or leads,Unchecked he hurries on;--nor heeds The sorrow, through the Villages,Spread by triumphant crueltiesOf vengeful military force,And punishment without remorse.He marked not, heard not, as he fledAll but the suffering heart was deadFor him abandoned to blank awe,To vacancy, and horror strong:And the first object which he saw,With conscious sight, as he swept along-- It was the Banner in his hand!He felt--and made a sudden stand.He looked about like one betrayed:What hath he done? what promise made?Oh weak, weak moment! to what endCan such a vain oblation tend,And he the Bearer?--Can he goCarrying this instrument of woe,And find, find anywhere, a rightTo excuse him in his Country\'s sight? No; will not all men deem the changeA downward course, perverse and strange?Here is it;--but how? when? must she,The unoffending Emily,Again this piteous object see?Such conflict long did he maintain,Nor liberty nor rest could gain:His own life into danger broughtBy this sad burden--even that thought,Exciting self-suspicion strong Swayed the brave man to his wrong.And how--unless it were the senseOf all-disposing Providence,Its will unquestionably shown--How has the Banner clung so fastTo a palsied, and unconscious hand;Clung to the hand to which it passedWithout impediment? And why,But that Heaven\'s purpose might be known,Doth now no hindrance meet his eye, No intervention, to withstandFulfilment of a Father\'s prayerBreathed to a Son forgiven, and blestWhen all resentments were at rest,And life in death laid the heart bare?--Then, like a spectre sweeping by,Rushed through his mind the prophecyOf utter desolation madeTo Emily in the yew-tree shade:He sighed, submitting will and power To the stern embrace of that grasping hour.\'No choice is left, the deed is mine--Dead are they, dead!--and I will go,And, for their sakes, come weal or woe,Will lay the Relic on the shrine.\'So forward with a steady willHe went, and traversed plain and hill;And up the vale of Wharf his wayPursued;--and, at the dawn of day,Attained a summit whence his eyes Could see the Tower of Bolton rise.There Francis for a moment\'s spaceMade halt--but hark! a noise behindOf horsemen at an eager pace!He heard, and with misgiving mind.--\'Tis Sir George Bowes who leads the Band:They come, by cruel Sussex sent;Who, when the Nortons from the handOf death had drunk their punishment,Bethought him, angry and ashamed, How Francis, with the Banner claimedAs his own charge, had disappeared,By all the standers-by revered.His whole bold carriage (which had quelledThus far the Opposer, and repelledAll censure, enterprise so brightThat even bad men had vainly strivenAgainst that overcoming light)Was then reviewed, and prompt word given,That to what place soever fled He should be seized, alive or dead.The troop of horse have gained the heightWhere Francis stood in open sight.They hem him round--\'Behold the proof,\'They cried, \'the Ensign in his hand!\'He\' did not arm, he walked aloof!For why?--to save his Father\'s land;--Worst Traitor of them all is he,A Traitor dark and cowardly!\'\'I am no Traitor,\' Francis said, \'Though this unhappy freight I bear;And must not part with.

\'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,And Benjamin, without a question,Taking her for some way-worn rover,Said, \'Mount, and get you under cover!\'Another voice, in tone as hoarseAs a swoln brook with rugged course,Cried out, \'Good brother, why so fast?I\'ve had a glimpse of you--\'avast!\'Or, since it suits you to be civil,Take her at once--for good and evil!\' \'It is my Husband,\' softly saidThe Woman, as if half afraid:By this time she was snug within,Through help of honest Benjamin;She and her Babe, which to her breastWith thankfulness the Mother pressed;And now the same strong voice more nearSaid cordially, \'My Friend, what cheer?Rough doings these!

The past he calmly hath reviewed:But where will be the fortitudeOf this brave man, when he shall seeThat Form beneath the spreading tree,And know that it is Emily?He saw her where in open viewShe sate beneath the spreading yew--Her head upon her lap, concealingIn solitude her bitter feeling:\'Might ever son \'command\' a sire, The act were justified to-day.\'This to himself--and to the Maid,Whom now he had approached, he said--\'Gone are they,--they have their desire;And I with thee one hour will stay,To give thee comfort if I may.\'She heard, but looked not up, nor spake;And sorrow moved him to partakeHer silence; then his thoughts turned round,And fervent words a passage found. \'Gone are they, bravely, though misled;With a dear Father at their head!The Sons obey a natural lord;The Father had given solemn wordTo noble Percy; and a forceStill stronger, bends him to his course.This said, our tears to-day may fallAs at an innocent funeral.In deep and awful channel runsThis sympathy of Sire and Sons; Untried our Brothers have been lovedWith heart by simple nature moved;And now their faithfulness is proved:For faithful we must call them, bearingThat soul of conscientious daring.--There were they all in circle--thereStood Richard, Ambrose, Christopher,John with a sword that will not fail,And Marmaduke in fearless mail,And those bright Twins were side by side; And there, by fresh hopes beautified,Stood He, whose arm yet lacks the powerOf man, our youngest, fairest flower!I, by the right of eldest born,And in a second father\'s place,Presumed to grapple with their scorn,And meet their pity face to face;Yea, trusting in God\'s holy aid,I to my Father knelt and prayed;And one, the pensive Marmaduke, Methought, was yielding inwardly,And would have laid his purpose by,But for a glance of his Father\'s eye,Which I myself could scarcely brook.Then be we, each and all, forgiven!Thou, chiefly thou, my Sister dear,Whose pangs are registered in heaven--The stifled sigh, the hidden tear,And smiles, that dared to take their place,Meek filial smiles, upon thy face, As that unhallowed Banner grewBeneath a loving old Man\'s view.Thy part is done--thy painful part;Be thou then satisfied in heart!A further, though far easier, taskThan thine hath been, my duties ask;With theirs my efforts cannot blend,I cannot for such cause contend;Their aims I utterly forswear;But I in body will be there.

Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene,Involved and restless all--a scenePregnant with mutual exaltation,Rich change, and multiplied creation!This sight to me the Muse imparts;--And then, what kindness in their hearts!What tears of rapture, what vow-making,Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!What solemn, vacant, interlacing,As if they\'d fall asleep embracing! Then, in the turbulence of glee,And in the excess of amity,Says Benjamin, \'That Ass of thine,He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:If he were tethered to the waggon,He\'d drag as well what he is dragging,And we, as brother should with brother,Might trudge it alongside each other!\'Forthwith, obedient to command,The horses made a quiet stand; And to the waggon\'s skirts was tiedThe Creature, by the Mastiff\'s side,The Mastiff wondering, and perplextWith dread of what will happen next;And thinking it but sorry cheer,To have such company so near!This new arrangement made, the WainThrough the still night proceeds again;No Moon hath risen her light to lend;But indistinctly may be kenned The VANGUARD, following close behind,Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!\'Thy wife and child are snug and warm,Thy ship will travel without harm;I like,\' said Benjamin, \'her shape and stature:And this of mine--this bulky creatureOf which I have the steering--this,Seen fairly, is not much amiss!We want your streamers, friend, you know;But, altogether as we go, We make a kind of handsome show!Among these hills, from first to last,We\'ve weathered many a furious blast;Hard passage forcing on, with headAgainst the storm, and canvas spread.I hate a boaster; but to theeWill say\'t, who know\'st both land and sea,The unluckiest hulk that stems the brineIs hardly worse beset than mine,When cross-winds on her quarter beat; And, fairly lifted from my feet,I stagger onward--heaven knows how;But not so pleasantly as now:Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,And many a foundrous pit surrounded!Yet here we are, by night and dayGrinding through rough and smooth our way;Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;And long shall be so yet--God willing!\'\'Ay,\' said the Tar, \'through fair and foul-- But save us from yon screeching owl!\'That instant was begun a frayWhich called their thoughts another way:The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!What must he do but growl and snarl,Still more and more dissatisfiedWith the meek comrade at his side!Till, not incensed though put to proof,The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,Salutes the Mastiff on the head; And so were better manners bred,And all was calmed and quieted.\'Yon screech-owl,\' says the Sailor, turningBack to his former cause of mourning,\'Yon owl!--pray God that all be well!\'Tis worse than any funeral bell;As sure as I\'ve the gift of sight,We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!\'--Said Benjamin, \'This whip shall layA thousand, if they cross our way. I know that Wanton\'s noisy station,I know him and his occupation;The jolly bird hath learned his cheerUpon the banks of Windermere;Where a tribe of them make merry,Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;Hallooing from an open throat,Like travellers shouting for a boat.--The tricks he learned at WindermereThis vagrant owl is playing here-- That is the worst of his employment:He\'s at the top of his enjoyment!\'This explanation stilled the alarm,Cured the foreboder like a charm;This, and the manner, and the voice,Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;His heart is up--he fears no evilFrom life or death, from man or devil;He wheels--and, making many stops,Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops; And, while he talked of blows and scars,Benjamin, among the stars,Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;Such retreating and advancingAs, I ween, was never seenIn bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Mary\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLet other bards of angels sing, Bright suns without a spot; But thou art no such perfect thing: Rejoice that thou art not!

Then, too, this Song \'of mine\' once more could please,Where anguish, strange as dreams of restless sleep,Is tempered and allayed by sympathiesAloft ascending, and descending deep,Even to the inferior Kinds; whom forest-treesProtect from beating sunbeams, and the sweepOf the sharp winds;--fair Creatures!--to whom HeavenA calm and sinless life, with love, hath given.This tragic Story cheered us; for it speaksOf female patience winning firm repose; And, of the recompense that conscience seeks,A bright, encouraging, example shows;Needful when o\'er wide realms the tempest breaks,Needful amid life\'s ordinary woes;--Hence, not for them unfitted who would blessA happy hour with holier happiness.He serves the Muses erringly and ill,Whose aim is pleasure light and fugitive:Oh, that my mind were equal to fulfilThe comprehensive mandate which they give-- Vain aspiration of an earnest will!Yet in this moral Strain a power may live,Beloved Wife! such solace to impartAs it hath yielded to thy tender heart.RYDAL MOUNT, WESTMORELAND,April , 1815._____________\'Action is transitory--a step, a blow,The motion of a muscle--this way or that--\'Tis done; and in the after-vacancyWe wonder at ourselves like men betrayed:Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,And has the nature of infinity.Yet through that darkness (infinite though it seemAnd irremoveable) gracious openings lie,By which the soul--with patient steps of thoughtNow toiling, waked now on wings of prayer-- May pass in hope, and, though from mortal bondsYet undelivered, rise with sure ascentEven to the fountain-head of peace divine.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDescriptive Sketches Taken During A Pedestrian Tour Among The Alps\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWERE there, below, a spot of holy ground      Where from distress a refuge might be found,      And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;       Sure, nature\'s God that spot to man had given      Where falls the purple morning far and wide      In flakes of light upon the mountain side;       Where with loud voice the power of water shakes      The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.        Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,      Who at the call of summer quits his home,         And plods through some wide realm o\'er vale and height,      Though seeking only holiday delight;       At least, not owning to himself an aim      To which the sage would give a prouder name.      No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,      Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;       Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,      Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.      For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn;       And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!           Dear is the forest frowning o\'er his head,      And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:      Moves there a cloud o\'er mid-day\'s flaming eye?       Upward he looks- \'and calls it luxury:\'      Kind Nature\'s charities his steps attend;       In every babbling brook he finds a friend;       While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed      By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.      Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,      To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;         He views the sun uplift his golden fire,      Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon\'s lyre;       Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,      To light him shaken by his rugged way.      Back from his sight no bashful children steal;       He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;       His humble looks no shy restraint impart;       Around him plays at will the virgin heart.      While unsuspended wheels the village dance,      The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,           Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,      Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.        A hope, that prudence could not then approve,      That clung to Nature with a truant\'s love,      O\'er Gallia\'s wastes of corn my footsteps led;       Her files of road-elms, high above my head      In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;       Or where her pathways straggle as they please      By lonely farms and secret villages.      But lo! the Alps ascending white in air,            Toy with the sun and glitter from afar.        And now, emerging from the forest\'s gloom,      I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom.      Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe      Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear?       \'That\' Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound,      Chains that were loosened only by the sound      Of holy rites chanted in measured round?       - The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms,      The cloister startles at the gleam of arms.       The thundering tube the aged angler hears,      Bent o\'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.      Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,      Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o\'erspreads;       Strong terror checks the female peasant\'s sighs,      And start the astonished shades at female eyes.      From Bruno\'s forest screams the affrighted jay,      And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.      A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock      The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock.       The \'parting Genius\' sighs with hollow breath      Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.      Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds      Portentous through her old woods\' trackless bounds,      Vallombre, \'mid her falling fanes, deplores,      For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.        More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves      Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.      No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps      Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.         - To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,      From ringing team apart and grating wain-       To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water\'s bound,      Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,      Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,      And o\'er the whitened wave their shadows fling-       The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;       And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.      The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees      From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;          Or marks, \'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids      Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;       Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view      Stretch o\'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,      And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,      As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.      Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed      In golden light; half hides itself in shade:      While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,      Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire:       There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw      Rich golden verdure on the lake below.      Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,      And steals into the shade the lazy oar;       Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,      And amorous music on the water dies.      How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets      Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;       Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales      Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales;             Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,      Each with its household boat beside the door;       Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;       Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows\' nests, on high;       That glimmer hoar in eve\'s last light, descried      Dim from the twilight water\'s shaggy side,      Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods      Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;       Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,      \'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning\'s ray           Slow-travelling down the western hills, to enfold      Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;       Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell      Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,      And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass      Along the steaming lake, to early mass.      But now farewell to each and all- adieu      To every charm, and last and chief to you,      Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade      Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;            To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,      Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;       Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume      The sylvan cabin\'s lute-enlivened gloom.      - Alas! the very murmur of the streams      Breathes o\'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,      While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell      On joys that might disgrace the captive\'s cell,      Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como\'s marge,      And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.          Yet are thy softer arts with power indued      To soothe and cheer the poor man\'s solitude.      By silent cottage-doors, the peasant\'s home      Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.      But once I pierced the mazes of a wood      In which a cabin undeserted stood;       There an old man an olden measure scanned      On a rude viol touched with withered hand.      As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie      Under a hoary oak\'s thin canopy,                    Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,      His children\'s children listened to the sound;       - A Hermit with his family around!         But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles      Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:      Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa\'s stream,      Where, \'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.      From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire      The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire      To where afar rich orange lustres glow               Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:      Or, led where Via Mala\'s chasms confine      The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,      Hang o\'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom      His burning eyes with fearful light illume.        The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go      O\'er life\'s long deserts with its charge of woe,      With sad congratulation joins the train      Where beasts and men together o\'er the plain      Move on- a mighty caravan of pain:                 Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,      Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.      - There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:      Sole human tenant of the piny waste,      By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,      A nursling babe her only comforter;       Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,      A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!         When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows      Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,              And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad      Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road-       She seeks a covert from the battering shower      In the roofed bridge; a the bridge, ill that dread hour,      Itself all trembling at the torrent\'s power.        Nor is she more at ease on some \'still\' night,      When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;       Only the waning moon hangs dull and red      Above a melancholy mountain\'s head,      Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,              Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;       Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,      Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,      Listens, or quakes while from the forest\'s gulf      Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf.        From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide      Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide;       By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,      Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;       By cells upon whose image, while he prays,              The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;       By many a votive death-cross planted near,      And watered duly with the pious tear,      That faded silent from the upward eye      Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh;       Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves      Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves.        But soon a peopled region on the sight      Opens- a little world of calm delight;       Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,             Spread rooflike o\'er the deep secluded vale,      And beams of evening slipping in between,      Gently illuminate a sober scene:-       Here, on the brown wood-cottages they sleep,      There, over rock or sloping pasture creep.      On as we journey, in clear view displayed,      The still vale lengthens underneath its shade      Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead      The green light sparkles; - the dim bowers recede.      While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,         And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,      In solemn shapes before the admiring eye      Dilated hang the misty pines on high,      Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,      And antique castles seen through gleamy showers.        From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!       To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri\'s lake      In Nature\'s pristine majesty outspread,      Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread:      The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch               Far o\'er the water, hung with groves of beech;       Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,      Nor stop but where creation seems to end.      Yet here and there, if mid the savage scene      Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,      Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep      To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep,      - Before those thresholds (never can they know      The face of traveller passing to and fro,)       No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell                 For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;       Their watch-dog ne\'er his angry bark foregoes,      Touched by the beggar\'s moan of human woes;       The shady porch ne\'er offered a cool seat      To pilgrims overcome by summer\'s heat.      Yet thither the world\'s business finds its way      At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,      And \'there\' are those fond thoughts which Solitude,      However stern, is powerless to exclude.      There doth the maiden watch her lover\'s sail                Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;       At midnight listens till his parting oar,      And its last echo, can be heard no more.        And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons, cry      Amid tempestuous vapours driving by,      Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear      That common growth of earth, the foodful ear;       Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,      And pines the unripened pear in summer\'s kindliest ray;       Contentment shares the desolate domain                     With Independence, child of high Disdain.      Exulting \'mid the winter of the skies,      Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,      And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;       And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds      The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,      And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,      Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste      Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast.        Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour,           All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:      The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:      Dark is the region as with coming night;       But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!       Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,      Glances the wheeling eagle\'s glorious form!       Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine      The wood-crowned cliffs that o\'er the lake recline;       Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold,      At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:            Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun      The \'west\', that burns like one dilated sun,      A crucible of mighty compass, felt      By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt.        But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before      The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;       Confused the Marathonian tale appears,      While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears.      And who, that walks where men of ancient days      Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,              Feels not the spirit of the place control,      Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul?       Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,      Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,      On Zutphen\'s plain; or on that highland dell,      Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell      What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought      Of him whom passion rivets to the spot,      Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe\'s happiest sigh,      And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard\'s eye;                    Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,      And glad Dundee in \'faint huzzas\' expired?         But now with other mind I stand alone      Upon the summit of this naked cone,      And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase      His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space,        Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave      A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,      Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;       Thro\' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;          Where silent Hours their deathlike sway extend,      Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend      Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned      In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,      Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound.      - \'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,      To see a planet\'s pomp and steady light      In the least star of scarce-appearing night;       While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound      Of ether, shining with diminished round,                    And far and wide the icy summits blaze,      Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:      To him the day-star glitters small and bright,      Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,      And he can look beyond the sun, and view      Those fast-receding depths of sable blue      Flying till vision can no more pursue!       - At once bewildering mists around him close,      And cold and hunger are his least of woes;       The Demon of the snow, with angry roar                       Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.      Soon with despair\'s whole weight his spirits sink;       Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;       And, ere his eyes can close upon the day,      The eagle of the Alps o\'ershades her prey.        Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar,      Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;       Or rather stay to taste the mild delights      Of pensive Underwalden\'s pastoral heights.      - Is there who \'mid these awful wilds has seen                 The native Genii walk the mountain green?       Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,      Soft music o\'er the aerial summit steal?       While o\'er the desert, answering every close,      Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.      - And sure there is a secret Power that reigns      Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,      Nought but the \'chalets\', flat and bare, on high      Suspended \'mid the quiet of the sky;       Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,                And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep.      How still! no irreligious sound or sight      Rouses the soul from her severe delight.      An idle voice the sabbath region fills      Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,      And with that voice accords the soothing sound      Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;       Faint wail of eagle melting into blue      Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods\' steady \'sugh\';       The solitary heifer\'s deepened low;                        Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow.      All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,      Blend in a music of tranquillity;       Save when, a stranger seen below, the boy      Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.        When, from the sunny breast of open seas,      And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze      Comes on to gladden April with the sight      Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height;       When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,              And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,      The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,      Leaving to silence the deserted vale;       And like the Patriarchs in their simple age      Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage:      High and more high in summer\'s heat they go,      And hear the rattling thunder far below;       Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,      Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd.        One I behold who, \'cross the foaming flood,              Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;       Another, high on that green ledge; - he gained      The tempting spot with every sinew strained;       And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,      Food for his beasts in time of winter snows.      - Far different life from what Tradition hoar      Transmits of happier lot in times of yore!       Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed      From out the rocks, the wild bees\' safe abode:      Continual waters welling cheered the waste,               And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:      Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,      Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:      Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,      To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare.      Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,      And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,      Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand.      Thus does the father to his children tell      Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well.          Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod      Of angry Nature to avenge her God.      Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts      Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.        \'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows      More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.      Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,      A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,      A solemn sea! whose billows wide around      Stand motionless, to awful silence bound:              Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,      That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.      A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,      Gapes in the centre of the sea- and, through      That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound      Innumerable streams with roar profound.      Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,      And merry flageolet; the low of herds,      The bark of dogs, the heifer\'s tinkling bell,      Talk, laughter, and perchance a churchtower knell:       Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed      And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised:      Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less      Alive to independent happiness,      Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at eventide      Upon the fragrant mountain\'s purple side:      For as the pleasures of his simple day      Beyond his native valley seldom stray,      Nought round its darling precincts can he find      But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;           While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure\'s urn,      Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return.        Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,      Was blest as free- for he was Nature\'s child.      He, all superior but his God disdained,      Walked none restraining, and by none restrained      Confessed no law but what his reason taught,      Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought.      As man in his primeval dower arrayed      The image of his glorious Sire displayed,                 Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here      The traces of primeval Man appear;       The simple dignity no forms debase;       The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:      The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,      His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword;       Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared      With this \'the blessings he enjoys to guard.\'        And, as his native hills encircle ground      For many a marvellous victory renowned,                The work of Freedom daring to oppose,      With few in arms, innumerable foes,      When to those famous fields his steps are led,      An unknown power connects him with the dead:      For images of other worlds are there;       Awful the light, and holy is the air.      Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,      Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;       His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,      Beyond the senses and their little reign.                  And oft, when that dread vision hath past by,      He holds with God himself communion high,      There where the peal of swelling torrents fills      The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;       Or when, upon the mountain\'s silent brow      Reclined, he sees, above him and below,      Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;       While needle peaks of granite shooting bare      Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.      And when a gathering weight of shadows brown             Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;       And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms,      Uplift in quiet their illumined forms,      In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,      Tinged like an angel\'s smile all rosy red-       Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,      And the near heavens impart their own delights.        When downward to his winter hut he goes,      Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;       That hut which on the hills so oft employs               His thoughts, the central point of all his joys.      And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,      Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,      So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends      A little prattling child, he oft descends,      To glance a look upon the well-matched pair;       Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.      There, safely guarded by the woods behind,      He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,      Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,           And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound.        Through Nature\'s vale his homely pleasures glide,      Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;       The bound of all his vanity, to deck,      With one bright bell, a favourite heifer\'s neck;       Well pleased upon some simple annual feast,      Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,      If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,      Of thrice ten summers dignify the board.      - Alas! in every clime a flying ray                        Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;       And here the unwilling mind may more than trace      The general sorrows of the human race;       The churlish gales of penury, that blow      Cold as the north-wind o\'er a waste of snow,      To them the gentle groups of bliss deny      That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.      Yet more; - compelled by Powers which only deign      That \'solitary\' man disturb their reign,      Powers that support an unremitting strife               With all the tender charities of life,      Full oft the father, when his sons have grown      To manhood, seems their title to disown;       And from his nest amid the storms of heaven      Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;       With stern composure watches to the plain-       And never, eagle-like, beholds again!         When long-familiar joys are all resigned,      Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind?       Lo! where through flat Batavia\'s willowy groves,           Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;       O\'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,      And search the affections to their inmost cell;       Sweet poison spreads along the listener\'s veins,      Turning past pleasures into mortal pains;       Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,      Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave.        Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!       Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume!       Fresh gales and dews of life\'s delicious morn,            And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!       Alas! the little joy to man allowed      Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud;       Or like the beauty in a flower installed,      Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.      Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,      And taught that pain is pleasure\'s natural heir,      We still confide in more than we can know;       Death would be else the favourite friend of woe.        \'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,          Between interminable tracts of pine,      Within a temple stands an awful shrine,      By an uncertain light revealed, that falls      On the mute Image and the troubled walls.      Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain      That views, undimmed, Einsiedlen\'s wretched fane.      While ghastly faces through the gloom appear,      Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear;       While prayer contends with silenced agony,      Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.                 If the sad grave of human ignorance bear      One flower of hope- oh, pass and leave it there!         The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire,      Flings o\'er the wilderness a stream of fire:      Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day      Close on the remnant of their weary way;       While they are drawing toward the sacred floor      Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more.      How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste      The fountains reared for them amid the waste!           Their thirst they slake:- they wash their toil-worn feet      And some with tears of joy each other greet.      Yes, I must see you when ye first behold      Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,      In that glad moment will for you a sigh      Be heaved, of charitable sympathy;       In that glad moment when your hands are prest      In mute devotion on the thankful breast!         Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields      With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields:           Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,      And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend; -       A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns      Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;       Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:      \'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned,      They sport beneath that mountain\'s matchless height      That holds no commerce with the summer night.      From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds      The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;                     Appalling havoc! but serene his brow,      Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow;       Glitter the stars above, and all is black below.        What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,      While roars the sullen Arve in anger by,      That not for thy reward, unrivalled Vale!       Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;       That thou, the slaves of slaves, art doomed to pine      And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,      To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine.             Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,      With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way,      On the bleak sides of Cumbria\'s heath-clad moors,      Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland\'s shores;       To scent the sweets of Piedmont\'s breathing rose,      And orange gale that o\'er Lugano blows;       Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,      That virtue languishes and pleasure fails,      While the remotest hamlets blessings share      In thy loved presence known, and only there;                 \'Heart\'-blessings- outward treasures too which the eye      Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,      And every passing breeze will testify.      There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound      Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound;       The housewife there a brighter garden sees,      Where hum on busier wing her happy bees;       On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;       And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,-       To greet the traveller needing food and rest;            Housed for the night, or but a half-hour\'s guest.        And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees      Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;       Though martial songs have banished songs of love,      And nightingales desert the village grove,      Scared by the fife and rumbling drum\'s alarms,      And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;       That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,      Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!       - Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power         Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:      All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes      Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.      Yes, as I roamed where Loiret\'s waters glide      Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,      When from October clouds a milder light      Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;       Methought from every cot the watchful bird      Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;       Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,            Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;       Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf      Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief;       The measured echo of the distant flail      Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;       With more majestic course the water rolled,      And ripening foliage shone with richer gold.      - But foes are gathering- Liberty must raise      Red on the hills her beacon\'s far-seen blaze;       Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower! -              Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour!       Rejoice, brave Land, though pride\'s perverted ire      Rouse hell\'s own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:      Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;       As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth!       - All cannot be: the promise is too fair      For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:      Yet not for this will sober reason frown      Upon that promise, nor the hope disown;       She knows that only from high aims ensue                     Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due.        Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed      In an impartial balance, give thine aid      To the just cause; and, oh! do thou preside      Over the mighty stream now spreading wide:      So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied      In copious showers, from earth by wholesome springs,      Brood o\'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings!       And grant that every sceptred child of clay      Who cries presumptuous, \'Here the flood shall stay,\'                 May in its progress see thy guiding hand,      And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand;       Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore,      Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more!         To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot      Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot      In timely sleep; and when, at break of day,      On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play,      With a light heart our course we may renew,      The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.                    1791 & 1792.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Oak Of Guernica Supposed Address To The Same\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOAK of Guernica!

The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.They look with wonder on the gifts--they gazeUpon Iulus, dazzled with the raysThat from his ardent countenance are flung,And charmed to hear his simulating tongue;Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine,Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.But chiefly Dido, to the coming illDevoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill; She views the gifts; upon the child then turnsInsatiable looks, and gazing burns.To ease a father\'s cheated love he hungUpon Aeneas, and around him clung;Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries;She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes,Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)How great a God, incumbent o\'er her breast,Would fill it with his spirit.

News from Mona\'s Isle?Such have we, but unvaried in its style; No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whenceAnd wherefore fugitive or on what pretence;Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the windMost restlessly alive when most confined.Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appeaseThe mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS;The last year\'s cup whose Ram or Heifer gained,What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained:An eye of fancy only can I castOn that proud pageant now at hand or past, When full five hundred boats in trim array,With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay,And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer,For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair,Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shineLike beds of moonlight shifting on the brine.Mona from our Abode is daily seen,But with a wilderness of waves between;And by conjecture only can we speakOf aught transacted there in bay or creek; No tidings reach us thence from town or field,Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield,And some we gather from the misty air,And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare.But these poetic mysteries I withhold;For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold,And should the colder fit with You be onWhen You might read, my credit would be gone.Let more substantial themes the pen engage,And nearer interests culled from the opening stage Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawnHad from the east her silver star withdrawn,The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door,Thoughtfully freighted with a various store;And long or ere the uprising of the SunO\'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun,A needful journey, under favouring skies,Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guiseOf those old Patriarchs when from well to wellThey roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabsdwell. Say first, to whom did we the charge confide,Who promptly undertook the Wain to guideUp many a sharply-twining road and down,And over many a wide hill\'s craggy crown,Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook,And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook?A blooming Lass--who in her better handBore a light switch, her sceptre of commandWhen, yet a slender Girl, she often led,Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar\'s head.What could go wrong with such a CharioteerFor goods and chattels, or those Infants dear,A Pair who smilingly sate side by side,Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tideWhose free embraces we were bound to seek,Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek?Such hope did either Parent entertainPacing behind along the silent lane.Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight, For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight--On a green bank a creature stood forlornJust half protruded to the light of morn,Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thornThe Figure called to mind a beast of preyStript of its frightful powers by slow decay,And, though no longer upon rapine bent,Dim memory keeping of its old intent.We started, looked again with anxious eyes,And in that griesly object recognise The Curate\'s Dog--his long-tried friend, for they,As well we knew, together had grown grey.The Master died, his drooping servant\'s griefFound at the Widow\'s feet some sad relief;Yet still he lived in pining discontent,Sadness which no indulgence could prevent;Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleepsAnd lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps;Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute!Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute, And of all visible motion destitute,So that the very heaving of his breathSeemed stopt, though by some other power than death.Long as we gazed upon the form and face,A mild domestic pity kept its place,Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hueThat haunted us in spite of what we knew.Even now I sometimes think of him as lostIn second-sight appearances, or crostBy spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground, On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound,Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to waitIn days of old romance at Archimago\'s gate.Advancing Summer, Nature\'s law fulfilled,The choristers in every grove had stilled;But we, we lacked not music of our own,For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown,Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues,Some notes prelusive, from the round of songsWith which, more zealous than the liveliest bird That in wild Arden\'s brakes was ever heard,Her work and her work\'s partners she can cheer,The whole day long, and all days of the year.Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we passAnd soon approach Diana\'s Looking-glass!To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven,Such name Italian fancy would have given,Ere on its banks the few grey cabins roseThat yet disturb not its concealed reposeMore than the feeblest wind that idly blows. Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the roadStopped me at once by charm of what it showed,The encircling region vividly exprestWithin the mirror\'s depth, a world at rest--Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield,And the smooth green of many a pendent field,And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small,A little daring would-be waterfall,One chimney smoking and its azure wreath,Associate all in the calm Pool beneath, With here and there a faint imperfect gleamOf water-lilies veiled in misty steam--What wonder at this hour of stillness deep,A shadowy link \'tween wakefulness and sleep,When Nature\'s self, amid such blending, seemsTo render visible her own soft dreams,If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood,Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood,A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by TheeDesigned to rise in humble privacy, A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread,Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful headHalf hid in native trees. Alas \'tis not,Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spotUnconscious of its own untoward lot,And thought in silence, with regret too keen,Of unexperienced joys that might have been;Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts,And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts.But time, irrevocable time, is flown. And let us utter thanks for blessings sownAnd reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own.Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee,Startling us all, dispersed my reverie;Such shout as many a sportive echo meetingOft-times from Alpine \'chalets\' sends a greeting.Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant standOn high, a kerchief waving in her hand!Not unexpectant that by early dayOur little Band would thrid this mountain way, Before her cottage on the bright hill sideShe hath advanced with hope to be descried.Right gladly answering signals we displayed,Moving along a tract of morning shade,And vocal wishes sent of like good willTo our kind Friend high on the sunny hill--Luminous region, fair as if the primeWere tempting all astir to look aloft or climb;Only the centre of the shining cotWith door left open makes a gloomy spot, Emblem of those dark corners sometimes foundWithin the happiest breast on earthly ground.Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale,And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale;Descend, and reach, in Yewdale\'s depths, a plainWith haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain--An area level as a Lake and spreadUnder a rock too steep for man to tread,Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwestAloft the Raven hangs a visible nest, Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest.Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark,At our approach, a jealous watch-dog\'s bark,Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state,But the whole household, that our coming wait.With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange,And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly GrangePress forward by the teasing dogs unscared.Entering, we find the morning meal prepared:So down we sit, though not till each had cast Pleased looks around the delicate repast--Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest,With amber honey from the mountain\'s breast;Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wildOf children\'s industry, in hillocks piled;Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lieUpon a lordly dish; frank hospitalityWhere simple art with bounteous nature vied,And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride.Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast, If thou be lovelier than the kindling East,Words by thy presence unrestrained may speakOf a perpetual dawn from brow and cheekInstinct with light whose sweetest promise lies,Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes,Dark but to every gentle feeling true,As if their lustre flowed from ether\'s purest blue.Let me not ask what tears may have been weptBy those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept,Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relievedBy fortitude and patience, and the graceOf heaven in pity visiting the place.Not unadvisedly those secret springsI leave unsearched: enough that memory clings,Here as elsewhere, to notices that makeTheir own significance for hearts awake,To rural incidents, whose genial powersFilled with delight three summer morning hours.More cold my pen report of grave or gay That through our gipsy travel cheered the way;But, bursting forth above the waves, the SunLaughs at my pains, and seems to say, \'Be done.\'Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reproveThis humble offering made by Truth to Love,Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spellWhich might have else been on me yet:--FAREWELL.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Martial Courage Of A Day Is Vain\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE martial courage of a day is vain,An empty noise of death the battle\'s roar,If vital hope be wanting to restore,Or fortitude be wanting to sustain,Armies or kingdoms.

And her Tyrolean Champion we beholdMurdered, like one ashore by shipwreck cast,Murdered without relief.

January 18, 1816\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIHAIL, orient Conqueror of gloomy Night!Thou that canst shed the bliss of gratitudeOn hearts howe\'er insensible or rude;Whether thy punctual visitations smiteThe haughty towers where monarchs dwell;Or thou, impartial Sun, with presence brightCheer\'st the low threshold of the peasant\'s cell!Not unrejoiced I see thee climb the skyIn naked splendour, clear from mist or haze,Or cloud approaching to divert the rays,Which even in deepest winter testifyThy power and majesty,Dazzling the vision that presumes to gaze.--Well does thine aspect usher in this Day;As aptly suits therewith that modest paceSubmitted to the chainsThat bind thee to the path which God ordainsThat thou shalt trace,Till, with the heavens and earth, thou pass away!Nor less, the stillness of these frosty plains,Their utter stillness, and the silent graceOf yon ethereal summits white with snow,(Whose tranquil pomp and spotless purityReport of storms gone byTo us who tread below)Do with the service of this Day accord.--Divinest Object which the uplifted eyeOf mortal man is suffered to behold;Thou, who upon those snow-clad Heights has pouredMeek lustre, nor forget\'st the humble Vale;Thou who dost warm Earth\'s universal mould,And for thy bounty wert not unadoredBy pious men of old;Once more, heart-cheering Sun, I bid thee hail!Bright be thy course to-day, let not this promise fail!II\'Mid the deep quiet of this morning hour,All nature seems to hear me while I speak,By feelings urged that do not vainly seekApt language, ready as the tuneful notesThat stream in blithe succession from the throatsOf birds, in leafy bower,Warbling a farewell to a vernal shower.--There is a radiant though a short-lived flame,That burns for Poets in the dawning east;And oft my soul hath kindled at the same,When the captivity of sleep had ceased;But He who fixed immoveably the frameOf the round world, and built, by laws as strong,A solid refuge for distress--The towers of righteousness;He knows that from a holier altar cameThe quickening spark of this day\'s sacrifice;Knows that the source is nobler whence doth riseThe current of this matin song;That deeper far it liesThan aught dependent on the fickle skies.IIIHave we not conquered?--by the vengeful sword?Ah no, by dint of Magnanimity;That curbed the baser passions, and left freeA loyal band to follow their liege LordClear-sighted Honour, and his staid Compeers,Along a track of most unnatural years;In execution of heroic deedsWhose memory, spotless as the crystal beadsOf morning dew upon the untrodden meads,Shall live enrolled above the starry spheres.He, who in concert with an earthly stringOf Britain\'s acts would sing,He with enraptured voice will tellOf One whose spirit no reverse could quell;Of One that \'mid the failing never failed--Who paints how Britain struggled and prevailedShall represent her labouring with an eyeOf circumspect humanity;Shall show her clothed with strength and skill,All martial duties to fulfil;Firm as a rock in stationary fight;In motion rapid as the lightning\'s gleam;Fierce as a flood-gate bursting at midnightTo rouse the wicked from their giddy dream--Woe, woe to all that face her in the field!Appalled she may not be, and cannot yield.IVAnd thus is \'missed\' the sole true gloryThat can belong to human story!At which they only shall arriveWho through the abyss of weakness dive.The very humblest are too proud of heart;And one brief day is rightly set apartFor Him who lifteth up and layeth low;For that Almighty God to whom we owe,Say not that we have vanquished--but that we survive.VHow dreadful the dominion of the impure!Why should the Song be tardy to proclaimThat less than power unbounded could not tameThat soul of Evil--which, from hell let loose,Had filled the astonished world with such abuseAs boundless patience only could endure?--Wide-wasted regions--cities wrapt in flame--Who sees, may lift a streaming eyeTo Heaven;--who never saw, may heave a sigh;But the foundation of our nature shakes,And with an infinite pain the spirit aches,When desolated countries, towns on fire,Are but the avowed attireOf warfare waged with desperate mindAgainst the life of virtue in mankind;Assaulting without ruthThe citadels of truth;While the fair gardens of civility,By ignorance defaced,By violence laid waste,Perish without reprieve for flower or tree!VIA crouching purpose--a distracted will--Opposed to hopes that battened upon scorn,And to desires whose ever-waxing hornNot all the light of earthly power could fill;Opposed to dark, deep plots of patient skill,And to celerities of lawless force;Which, spurning God, had flung away remorse--What could they gain but shadows of redress?--So bad proceeded propagating worse;And discipline was passion\'s dire excess.Widens the fatal web, its lines extend,And deadlier poisons in the chalice blend.When will your trials teach you to be wise?--O prostrate Lands, consult your agonies!VIINo more--the guilt is banished,And, with the guilt, the shame is fled;And, with the guilt and shame, the Woe hath vanished,Shaking the dust and ashes from her head!--No more--these lingerings of distressSully the limpid stream of thankfulness.What robe can Gratitude employSo seemly as the radiant vest of Joy?What steps so suitable as those that moveIn prompt obedience to spontaneous measuresOf glory, and felicity, and love,Surrendering the whole heart to sacred pleasures?VIIIO Britain! dearer far than life is dear,If one there beOf all thy progenyWho can forget thy prowess, never moreBe that ungrateful Son allowed to hearThy green leaves rustle or thy torrents roar.As springs the lion from his den,As from a forest-brakeUpstarts a glistering snake,The bold Arch-despot re-appeared;--againWide Europe heaves, impatient to be cast,With all her armed Powers,On that offensive soil, like waves upon a thousand shores.The trumpet blew a universal blast!But Thou art foremost in the field:--there stand:Receive the triumph destined to thy hand!All States have glorified themselves;--their claimsAre weighed by Providence, in balance even;And now, in preference to the mightiest names,To Thee the exterminating sword is given.Dread mark of approbation, justly gained!Exalted office, worthily sustained!IXPreserve, O Lord! within our heartsThe memory of thy favour,That else insensibly departs,And loses its sweet savour!Lodge it within us!--as the power of lightLives inexhaustibly in precious gems,Fixed on the front of Eastern diadems,So shine our thankfulness for ever bright!What offering, what transcendent monumentShall our sincerity to Thee present?--Not work of hands; but trophies that may reachTo highest Heaven--the labour of the Soul;That builds, as thy unerring precepts teach,Upon the internal conquests made by each,Her hope of lasting glory for the whole.Yet will not heaven disown nor earth gainsayThe outward service of this day;Whether the worshippers entreatForgiveness from God\'s mercy-seat;Or thanks and praises to His throne ascendThat He has brought our warfare to an end,And that we need no second victory!--Ha! what a ghastly sight for man to see;And to the heavenly saints in peace who dwell,For a brief moment, terrible;But, to thy sovereign penetration, fair,Before whom all things are, that were,All judgments that have been, or e\'er shall be;Links in the chain of thy tranquillity!Along the bosom of this favoured Nation,Breathe Thou, this day, a vital undulation!Let all who do this land inheritBe conscious of thy moving spirit!Oh, \'tis a goodly Ordinance,--the sight,Though sprung from bleeding war, is one of pure delight;Bless Thou the hour, or ere the hour arrive,When a whole people shall kneel down in prayer,And, at one moment, in one rapture, striveWith lip and heart to tell their gratitudeFor thy protecting care,Their solemn joy--praising the Eternal LordFor tyranny subdued,And for the sway of equity renewed,For liberty confirmed, and peace restored!XBut hark--the summons!--down the placid lakeFloats the soft cadence of the church-tower bells;Bright shines the Sun, as if his beams would wakeThe tender insects sleeping in their cells;Bright shines the Sun--and not a breeze to shakeThe drops that tip the melting icicles.\'O, enter now his temple gate!\'Inviting words--perchance already flung(As the crowd press devoutly down the aisleOf some old Minster\'s venerable pile)From voices into zealous passion stung,While the tubed engine feels the inspiring blast,And has begun--its clouds of sound to castForth towards empyreal Heaven,As if the fretted roof were riven.\'Us\', humbler ceremonies now await;But in the bosom, with devout respectThe banner of our joy we will erect,And strength of love our souls shall elevate:For to a few collected in his name,Their heavenly Father will incline an earGracious to service hallowed by its aim;--Awake! the majesty of God revere!Go--and with foreheads meekly bowedPresent your prayers--go--and rejoice aloud--The Holy One will hear!And what, \'mid silence deep, with faith sincere,Ye, in

voice; it said, \'Drink, pretty creature, drink!\'And, looking o\'er the hedge, before me I espiedA snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook. \'Drink, pretty creature, drink,\' she said in such a toneThat I almost received her heart into my own.\'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair.Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away:But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady placeI unobserved could see the workings of her face:If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing: \'What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord?Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;Rest, little young One, rest; what is\'t that aileth thee?\'What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!\'If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain; For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need\'st not fear,The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.\'Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the dayWhen my father found thee first in places far away;Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.\'He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yeanUpon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been. \'Thou know\'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this canFresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.\'Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,Then I\'ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is coldOur hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.\'It will not, will not rest!--Poor creature, can it beThat \'tis thy mother\'s heart which is working so in thee?

his boat and twinkling oar.My father was a good and pious man,An honest man, by honest parents bred,And I believe that, soon as I beganTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,And in his hearing there my prayers I said:And afterwards, by my good father taught,I read, and loved the books in which I read;For books in every neighboring house I sought,And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.Can I forget what charms did once adornMy garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme,And rose and lily for the sabbath morn?The sabbath bells, and the delightful chime;The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time;My hen\'s rich nest through long grass scarce espied;The cowslip-gathering at May\'s dewy prime;The swans, that when I sought the water-side,From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride.The staff I yet remember which upboreThe bending body of my active sire;His seat beneath the honeyed sycamoreWhen the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;When market-morning came, the neat attireWith which, though bent on haste, myself I deck\'d;My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire,When stranger passed, so often I have check\'d;The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck\'d.The suns of twenty summers danced along, -Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away:Then rose a mansion proud our woods among,And cottage after cottage owned its sway,No joy to see a neighboring house, or strayThrough pastures not his own, the master took;My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay;He loved his old hereditary nook,And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook.But, when he had refused the proffered gold,To cruel injuries he became a prey,Sore traversed in whate\'er he bought and sold:His troubles grew upon him day by day,Till all his substance fell into decay.His little range of water was denied;All but the bed where his old body lay,All, all was seized, and weeping, side by side,We sought a home where we uninjured might abide.Can I forget that miserable hour,When from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,Peering above the trees, the steeple tower,That on his marriage-day sweet music made?Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid,Close by my mother in their native bowers:Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed, \\\'f3 I could not pray: \\\'f3 through tears that fell in showers,Glimmer\'d our dear-loved home, alas!

Then peace to cruelty and scorn,While to the prison they are borne,Peace, peace to all indignity!\'And so in Prison were they laid--Oh hear me, hear me, gentle Maid,For I am come with power to bless,By scattering gleams, through your distress,Of a redeeming happiness.Me did a reverent pity moveAnd privilege of ancient love; And, in your service, making bold,Entrance I gained to that stronghold.Your Father gave me cordial greeting;But to his purposes, that burnedWithin him, instantly returned:He was commanding and entreating,And said--\'We need not stop, my Son!Thoughts press, and time is hurrying on\'--And so to Francis he renewedHis words, more calmly thus pursued. \'Might this our enterprise have sped,Change wide and deep the Land had seen,A renovation from the dead,A spring-tide of immortal green:The darksome altars would have blazedLike stars when clouds are rolled away;Salvation to all eyes that gazed,Once more the Rood had been upraisedTo spread its arms, and stand for aye.Then, then--had I survived to see New life in Bolton Priory;The voice restored, the eye of TruthRe-opened that inspired my youth;To see her in her pomp arrayed--This Banner (for such vow I made)Should on the consecrated breastOf that same Temple have found rest:I would myself have hung it high,Fit offering of glad victory!A shadow of such thought remains To cheer this sad and pensive time;A solemn fancy yet sustainsOne feeble Being--bids me climbEven to the last--one effort moreTo attest my Faith, if not restore.Hear then,\' said he, \'while I impart,My Son, the last wish of my heart.The Banner strive thou to regain;And, if the endeavour prove not vain,Bear it--to whom if not to thee Shall I this lonely thought consign?--Bear it to Bolton Priory,And lay it on Saint Mary\'s shrine;To wither in the sun and breeze\'Mid those decaying sanctities.There let at least the gift be laid,The testimony there displayed;Bold proof that with no selfish aim,But for lost Faith and Christ\'s dear name,I helmeted a brow though white, And took a place in all men\'s sight;Yea offered up this noble Brood,This fair unrivalled Brotherhood,And turned away from thee, my Son!And left--but be the rest unsaid,The name untouched, the tear unshed;--My wish is known, and I have done:Now promise, grant this one request,This dying prayer, and be thou blest!\'Then Francis answered--\'Trust thy Son, For, with God\'s will, it shall be done!\'--The pledge obtained, the solemn wordThus scarcely given, a noise was heard,And Officers appeared in stateTo lead the prisoners to their fate.They rose, oh! wherefore should I fearTo tell, or, Lady, you to hear?They rose--embraces none were given--They stood like trees when earth and heavenAre calm; they knew each other\'s worth, And reverently the Band went forth.They met, when they had reached the door,One with profane and harsh intentPlaced there--that he might go beforeAnd, with that rueful Banner borneAloft in sign of taunting scorn,Conduct them to their punishment:So cruel Sussex, unrestrainedBy human feeling, had ordained.The unhappy Banner Francis saw, And, with a look of calm commandInspiring universal awe,He took it from the soldier\'s hand;And all the people that stood roundConfirmed the deed in peace profound.--High transport did the Father shedUpon his Son--and they were led,Led on, and yielded up their breath;Together died, a happy death!--But Francis, soon as he had braved That insult, and the Banner saved,Athwart the unresisting tideOf the spectators occupiedIn admiration or dismay,Bore instantly his Charge away.\'These things, which thus had in the sightAnd hearing passed of Him who stoodWith Emily, on the Watch-tower height,In Rylstone\'s woeful neighbourhood,He told; and oftentimes with voice Of power to comfort or rejoice;For deepest sorrows that aspire,Go high, no transport ever higher.\'Yes--God is rich in mercy,\' saidThe old Man to the silent Maid,\'Yet, Lady! shines, through this black night,One star of aspect heavenly bright;Your Brother lives--he lives--is comePerhaps already to his home;Then let us leave this dreary place.\' She yielded, and with gentle pace,Though without one uplifted look,To Rylstone-hall her way she took.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM Bolton\'s old monastic towerThe bells ring loud with gladsome power;The sun shines bright; the fields are gayWith people in their best arrayOf stole and doublet, hood and scarf,Along the banks of crystal Wharf,Through the Vale retired and lowly,Trooping to that summons holy.And, up among the moorlands, seeWhat sprinklings of blithe company! Of lasses and of shepherd grooms,That down the steep hills force their way,Like cattle through the budded brooms;Path, or no path, what care they?And thus in joyous mood they hieTo Bolton\'s mouldering Priory.What would they there?--Full fifty yearsThat sumptuous Pile, with all its peers,Too harshly hath been doomed to tasteThe bitterness of wrong and waste: Its courts are ravaged; but the towerIs standing with a voice of power,That ancient voice which wont to callTo mass or some high festival;And in the shattered fabric\'s heartRemaineth one protected part;A Chapel, like a wild-bird\'s nest,Closely embowered and trimly drest;And thither young and old repair,This Sabbath-day, for praise and prayer. Fast the churchyard fills;--anonLook again, and they all are gone;The cluster round the porch, and the folkWho sate in the shade of the Prior\'s Oak!And scarcely have they disappearedEre the prelusive hymn is heard:--With one consent the people rejoice,Filling the church with a lofty voice!They sing a service which they feel:For \'tis the sunrise now of zeal; Of a pure faith the vernal prime--In great Eliza\'s golden time.A moment ends the fervent din,And all is hushed, without and within;For though the priest, more tranquilly,Recites the holy liturgy,The only voice which you can hearIs the river murmuring near.--When soft!--the dusky trees between,And down the path through the open green, Where is no living thing to be seen;And through yon gateway, where is found,Beneath the arch with ivy bound,Free entrance to the churchyard ground--Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,Comes gliding in serene and slow,Soft and silent as a dream,A solitary Doe!White she is as lily of June,And beauteous as the silver moon When out of sight the clouds are drivenAnd she is left alone in heaven;Or like a ship some gentle dayIn sunshine sailing far away,A glittering ship, that hath the plainOf ocean for her own domain.Lie silent in your graves, ye dead!Lie quiet in your churchyard bed!Ye living, tend your holy cares;Ye multitude, pursue your prayers; And blame not me if my heart and sightAre occupied with one delight!\'Tis a work for sabbath hoursIf I with this bright Creature go:Whether she be of forest bowers,From the bowers of earth below;Or a Spirit for one day given,A pledge of grace from purest heaven.What harmonious pensive changesWait upon her as she ranges Round and through this Pile of stateOverthrown and desolate!Now a step or two her wayLeads through space of open day,Where the enamoured sunny lightBrightens her that was so bright;Now doth a delicate shadow fall,Falls upon her like a breath,From some lofty arch or wall,As she passes underneath: Now some gloomy nook partakesOf the glory that she makes,--High-ribbed vault of stone, or cell,With perfect cunning framed as wellOf stone, and ivy, and the spreadOf the elder\'s bushy head;Some jealous and forbidding cell,That doth the living stars repel,And where no flower hath leave to dwell.The presence of this wandering Doe Fills many a damp obscure recessWith lustre of a saintly show;And, reappearing, she no lessSheds on the flowers that round her blowA more than sunny liveliness.But say, among these holy places,Which thus assiduously she paces,Comes she with a votary\'s task,Rite to perform, or boon to ask?Fair Pilgrim! harbours she a sense Of sorrow, or of reverence?Can she be grieved for quire or shrine,Crushed as if by wrath divine?For what survives of house where GodWas worshipped, or where Man abode;For old magnificence undone;Or for the gentler work begunBy Nature, softening and concealing,And busy with a hand of healing?Mourns she for lordly chamber\'s hearth That to the sapling ash gives birth;For dormitory\'s length laid bareWhere the wild rose blossoms fair;Or altar, whence the cross was rent,Now rich with mossy ornament?--She sees a warrior carved in stone,Among the thick weeds, stretched alone;A warrior, with his shield of prideCleaving humbly to his side,And hands in resignation prest, Palm to palm, on his tranquil breast;As little she regards the sightAs a common creature might:If she be doomed to inward care,Or service, it must lie elsewhere.--But hers are eyes serenely bright,And on she moves--with pace how light!Nor spares to stoop her head, and tasteThe dewy turf with flowers bestrown;And thus she fares, until at last Beside the ridge of a grassy graveIn quietness she lays her down;Gentle as a weary waveSinks, when the summer breeze hath died,Against an anchored vessel\'s side;Even so, without distress, doth sheLie down in peace, and lovingly.The day is placid in its going,To a lingering motion bound,Like the crystal stream now flowing With its softest summer sound:So the balmy minutes pass,While this radiant Creature liesCouched upon the dewy grass,Pensively with downcast eyes.--But now again the people raiseWith awful cheer a voice of praise;It is the last, the parting song;And from the temple forth they throng,And quickly spread themselves abroad, While each pursues his several road.But some--a variegated bandOf middle-aged, and old, and young,And little children by the handUpon their leading mothers hung--With mute obeisance gladly paidTurn towards the spot, where, full in view,The white Doe, to her service true,Her sabbath couch has made.It was a solitary mound; Which two spears\' length of level groundDid from all other graves divide:As if in some respect of pride;Or melancholy\'s sickly mood,Still shy of human neighbourhood;Or guilt, that humbly would expressA penitential loneliness.\'Look, there she is, my Child! draw near;She fears not, wherefore should we fear?She means no harm;\'--but still the Boy, To whom the words were softly said,Hung back, and smiled, and blushed for joy,A shame-faced blush of glowing red!Again the Mother whispered low,\'Now you have seen the famous Doe;From Rylstone she hath found her wayOver the hills this sabbath dayHer work, whate\'er it be, is done,And she will depart when we are gone;Thus doth she keep, from year to year, Her sabbath morning, foul or fair.\'Bright was the Creature, as in dreamsThe Boy had seen her, yea, more bright;But is she truly what she seems?He asks with insecure delight,Asks of himself, and doubts,--and stillThe doubt returns against his will:Though he, and all the standers-by,Could tell a tragic historyOf facts divulged, wherein appear Substantial motive, reason clear,Why thus the milk-white Doe is foundCouchant beside that lonely mound;And why she duly loves to paceThe circuit of this hallowed place.Nor to the Child\'s inquiring mindIs such perplexity confined:For, spite of sober Truth that seesA world of fixed remembrancesWhich to this mystery belong, If, undeceived, my skill can traceThe characters of every face,There lack not strange delusion here,Conjecture vague, and idle fear,And superstitious fancies strong,Which do the gentle Creature wrong.That bearded, staff-supported Sire--Who in his boyhood often fedFull cheerily on convent-breadAnd heard old tales by the convent-fire, And to his grave will go with scars,Relics of long and distant wars--That Old Man, studious to expoundThe spectacle, is mounting highTo days of dim antiquity;When Lady Aaliza mournedHer Son, and felt in her despairThe pang of unavailing prayer;Her Son in Wharf\'s abysses drowned,The noble Boy of Egremound. From which affliction--when the graceOf God had in her heart found place--A pious structure, fair to seeRose up, this stately Priory!The Lady\'s work;--but now laid low;To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustainA softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright; And glides o\'er the earth like an angel of light.Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;And, through the chink in the fractured floorLook down, and see a griesly sight;A vault where the bodies are buried upright!There, face by face, and hand by hand,The Claphams and Mauleverers stand;And, in his place, among son and sire,Is John de Clapham, that fierce Esquire,A valiant man, and a name of dread In the ruthless wars of the White and Red;Who dragged Earl Pembroke from Banbury churchAnd smote off his head on the stones of the porch!Look down among them, if you dare;Oft does the White Doe loiter there,Prying into the darksome rent;Nor can it be with good intent:So thinks that Dame of haughty air,Who hath a Page her book to hold,And wears a frontlet edged with gold. Harsh thoughts with her high mood agree--Who counts among her ancestryEarl Pembroke, slain so impiously!That slender Youth, a scholar pale,From Oxford come to his native vale,He also hath his own conceit:It is, thinks he, the gracious Fairy,Who loved the Shepherd-lord to meetIn his wanderings solitary:Wild notes she in his hearing sang, A song of Nature\'s hidden powers;That whistled like the wind, and rangAmong the rocks and holly bowers.\'Twas said that She all shapes could wear;And oftentimes before him stood,Amid the trees of some thick wood,In semblance of a lady fair;And taught him signs, and showed him sights,In Craven\'s dens, on Cumbrian heights;When under cloud of fear he lay, A shepherd clad in homely grey;Nor left him at his later day.And hence, when he, with spear and shield,Rode full of years to Flodden-field,His eye could see the hidden spring,And how the current was to flow;The fatal end of Scotland\'s King,And all that hopeless overthrow.But not in wars did he delight,\'This\' Clifford wished for worthier might; Nor in broad pomp, or courtly state;Him his own thoughts did elevate,--Most happy in the shy recessOf Barden\'s lowly quietness.And choice of studious friends had heOf Bolton\'s dear fraternity;Who, standing on this old church tower,In many a calm propitious hour,Perused, with him, the starry sky;Or, in their cells, with him did pry For other lore,--by keen desireUrged to close toil with chemic fire;In quest belike of transmutationsRich as the mine\'s most bright creations.But they and their good works are fled,And all is now disquieted--And peace is none, for living or dead!Ah, pensive Scholar, think not so,But look again at the radiant Doe!What quiet watch she seems to keep, Alone, beside that grassy heap!Why mention other thoughts unmeetFor vision so composed and sweet?While stand the people in a ring,Gazing, doubting, questioning;Yea, many overcome in spiteOf recollections clear and bright;Which yet do unto some impartAn undisturbed repose of heart.And all the assembly own a law Of orderly respect and awe;But see--they vanish one by one,And last, the Doe herself is gone.Harp! we have been full long beguiledBy vague thoughts, lured by fancies wild;To which, with no reluctant strings,Thou hast attuned thy murmurings;And now before this Pile we standIn solitude, and utter peace:But, Harp! thy murmurs may not cease-- A Spirit, with his angelic wings,In soft and breeze-like visitings,Has touched thee--and a Spirit\'s hand:A voice is with us--a commandTo chant, in strains of heavenly glory,A tale of tears, a mortal story!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto Seventh\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Powers there areThat touch each other to the quick--in modesWhich the gross world no sense hath to perceive,No soul to dream of.\'THOU Spirit, whose angelic handWas to the harp a strong command,Called the submissive strings to wakeIn glory for this Maiden\'s sake,Say, Spirit! whither hath she fledTo hide her poor afflicted head?What mighty forest in its gloomEnfolds her?--is a rifted tombWithin the wilderness her seat?Some island which the wild waves beat-- Is that the Sufferer\'s last retreat?Or some aspiring rock, that shroudsIts perilous front in mists and clouds?High-climbing rock, low sunless dale,Sea, desert, what do these avail?Oh take her anguish and her fearsInto a deep recess of years!\'Tis done;--despoil and desolationO\'er Rylstone\'s fair domain have blown;Pools, terraces, and walks are sown With weeds; the bowers are overthrown,Or have given way to slow mutation,While, in their ancient habitationThe Norton name hath been unknown.The lordly Mansion of its prideIs stripped; the ravage hath spread wideThrough park and field, a perishingThat mocks the gladness of the Spring!And, with this silent gloom agreeing,Appears a joyless human Being, Of aspect such as if the wasteWere under her dominion placed.Upon a primrose bank, her throneOf quietness, she sits alone;Among the ruins of a wood,Erewhile a covert bright and green,And where full many a brave tree stood,That used to spread its boughs, and ringWith the sweet bird\'s carolling.Behold her, like a virgin Queen, Neglecting in imperial stateThese outward images of fate,And carrying inward a sereneAnd perfect sway, through many a thoughtOf chance and change, that hath been broughtTo the subjection of a holy,Though stern and rigorous, melancholy!The like authority, with graceOf awfulness, is in her face,--There hath she fixed it; yet it seems To o\'ershadow by no native rightThat face, which cannot lose the gleams,Lose utterly the tender gleams,Of gentleness and meek delight,And loving-kindness ever bright:Such is her sovereign mien:--her dress(A vest with woollen cincture tied,A hood of mountain-wool undyed)Is homely,--fashioned to expressA wandering Pilgrim\'s humbleness. And she \'hath\' wandered, long and far,Beneath the light of sun and star;Hath roamed in trouble and in grief,Driven forward like a withered leaf,Yea like a ship at random blownTo distant places and unknown.But now she dares to seek a havenAmong her native wilds of Craven;Hath seen again her Father\'s roof,And put her fortitude to proof; The mighty sorrow hath been borne,And she is thoroughly forlorn:Her soul doth in itself stand fast,Sustained by memory of the pastAnd strength of Reason; held aboveThe infirmities of mortal love;Undaunted, lofty, calm, and stable,And awfully impenetrable.And so--beneath a mouldered tree,A self-surviving leafless oak By unregarded age from strokeOf ravage saved--sate Emily.There did she rest, with head reclined,Herself most like a stately flower,(Such have I seen) whom chance of birthHath separated from its kind,To live and die in a shady bower,Single on the gladsome earth.When, with a noise like distant thunder,A troop of deer came sweeping by; And, suddenly, behold a wonder!For One, among those rushing deer,A single One, in mid careerHath stopped, and fixed her large full eyeUpon the Lady Emily;A Doe most beautiful, clear-white,A radiant creature, silver-bright!Thus checked, a little while it stayed;A little thoughtful pause it made;And then advanced with stealth-like pace, Drew softly near her, and more near--Looked round--but saw no cause for fear;So to her feet the Creature came,And laid its head upon her knee,And looked into the Lady\'s face,A look of pure benignity,And fond unclouded memory.It is, thought Emily, the same,The very Doe of other years!--The pleading look the Lady viewed, And, by her gushing thoughts subdued,She melted into tears--A flood of tears, that flowed apace,Upon the happy Creature\'s face.Oh, moment ever blest! O PairBeloved of Heaven, Heaven\'s chosen care,This was for you a precious greeting;And may it prove a fruitful meeting!Joined are they, and the sylvan DoeCan she depart? can she forego The Lady, once her playful peer,And now her sainted Mistress dear?And will not Emily receiveThis lovely chronicler of thingsLong past, delights and sorrowings?Lone Sufferer! will not she believeThe promise in that speaking face;And welcome, as a gift of grace,The saddest thought the Creature brings?That day, the first of a re-union Which was to teem with high communion,That day of balmy April weather,They tarried in the wood together.And when, ere fall of evening dew,She from her sylvan haunt withdrew,The White Doe tracked with faithful paceThe Lady to her dwelling-place;That nook where, on paternal ground,A habitation she had found,The Master of whose humble board Once owned her Father for his Lord;A hut, by tufted trees defended,Where Rylstone brook with Wharf is blended.When Emily by morning lightWent forth, the Doe stood there in sight.She shrunk:--with one frail shock of painReceived and followed by a prayer,She saw the Creature once again;Shun will she not, she feels, will bear;--But, wheresoever she looked round, All now was trouble-haunted ground;And therefore now she deems it goodOnce more this restless neighbourhoodTo leave.--Unwooed, yet unforbidden,The White Doe followed up the vale,Up to another cottage, hiddenIn the deep fork of Amerdale;And there may Emily restoreHerself, in spots unseen before.--Why tell of mossy rock, or tree, By lurking Dernbrook\'s pathless side,Haunts of a strengthening amityThat calmed her, cheered, and fortified?For she hath ventured now to readOf time, and place, and thought, and deed--Endless history that liesIn her silent Follower\'s eyes;Who with a power like human reasonDiscerns the favourable season,Skilled to approach or to retire,-- From looks conceiving her desire;From look, deportment, voice, or mien,That vary to the heart within.If she too passionately wreathedHer arms, or over-deeply breathed,Walked quick or slowly, every moodIn its degree was understood;Then well may their accord be true,And kindliest intercourse ensue.--Oh! surely \'twas a gentle rousing When she by sudden glimpse espiedThe White Doe on the mountain browsing,Or in the meadow wandered wide!How pleased, when down the Straggler sankBeside her, on some sunny bank!How soothed, when in thick bower enclosed,They, like a nested pair, reposed!Fair Vision! when it crossed the MaidWithin some rocky cavern laid,The dark cave\'s portal gliding by, White as whitest cloud on highFloating through the azure sky.--What now is left for pain or fear?That Presence, dearer and more dear,While they, side by side, were straying,And the shepherd\'s pipe was playing,Did now a very gladness yieldAt morning to the dewy field,And with a deeper peace enduedThe hour of moonlight solitude. With her Companion, in such frameOf mind, to Rylstone back she came;And, ranging through the wasted groves,Received the memory of old loves,Undisturbed and undistrest,Into a soul which now was blestWith a soft spring-day of holy,Mild, and grateful, melancholy:Not sunless gloom or unenlightened,But by tender fancies brightened. When the bells of Rylstone playedTheir sabbath music--\'God us ayde!\'That was the sound they seemed to speak;Inscriptive legend which I weenMay on those holy bells be seen,That legend and her Grandsire\'s name;And oftentimes the Lady meekHad in her childhood read the same;Words which she slighted at that day;But now, when such sad change was wrought, And of that lonely name she thought--The bells of Rylstone seemed to say,While she sate listening in the shade,With vocal music, \'God us ayde;\'And all the hills were glad to bearTheir part in this effectual prayer.Nor lacked she Reason\'s firmest power;But with the White Doe at her sideUp would she climb to Norton Tower,And thence look round her far and wide, Her fate there measuring;--all is stilled,--The weak One hath subdued her heart;Behold the prophecy fulfilled,Fulfilled, and she sustains her part!But here her Brother\'s words have failed;Here hath a milder doom prevailed;That she, of him and all bereft,Hath yet this faithful Partner left;This one Associate, that disprovesHis words, remains for her, and loves. If tears are shed, they do not fallFor loss of him--for one, or all;Yet, sometimes, sometimes doth she weepMoved gently in her soul\'s soft sleep;A few tears down her cheek descendFor this her last and living Friend.Bless, tender Hearts, their mutual lot,And bless for both this savage spot;Which Emily doth sacred holdFor reasons dear and manifold-- Here hath she, here before her sight,Close to the summit of this height,The grassy rock-encircled PoundIn which the Creature first was found.So beautiful the timid Thrall(A spotless Youngling white as foam)Her youngest Brother brought it home;The youngest, then a lusty boy,Bore it, or led, to Rylstone-hallWith heart brimful of pride and joy! But most to Bolton\'s sacred Pile,On favouring nights, she loved to go;There ranged through cloister, court, and aisle,Attended by the soft-paced Doe;Nor feared she in the still moonshineTo look upon Saint Mary\'s shrine;Nor on the lonely turf that showedWhere Francis slept in his last abode.For that she came; there oft she sateForlorn, but not disconsolate: And, when she from the abyss returnedOf thought, she neither shrunk nor mourned;Was happy that she lived to greetHer mute Companion as it layIn love and pity at her feet;How happy in its turn to meetThe recognition! the mild glanceBeamed from that gracious countenance;Communication, like the rayOf a new morning, to the nature And prospects of the inferior Creature!A mortal Song we sing, by dowerEncouraged of celestial power;Power which the viewless Spirit shedBy whom we were first visited;Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wingsSwept like a breeze the conscious strings,When, left in solitude, erewhileWe stood before this ruined Pile,And, quitting unsubstantial dreams, Sang in this Presence kindred themes;Distress and desolation spreadThrough human hearts, and pleasure dead,--Dead--but to live again on earth,A second and yet nobler birth;Dire overthrow, and yet how highThe re-ascent in sanctity!From fair to fairer; day by dayA more divine and loftier way!Even such this blessed Pilgrim trod, By sorrow lifted towards her God;Uplifted to the purest skyOf undisturbed mortality.Her own thoughts loved she; and could bendA dear look to her lowly Friend;There stopped; her thirst was satisfiedWith what this innocent spring supplied:Her sanction inwardly she bore,And stood apart from human cares:But to the world returned no more, Although with no unwilling mindHelp did she give at need, and joinedThe Wharfdale peasants in their prayers.At length, thus faintly, faintly tiedTo earth, she was set free, and died.Thy soul, exalted Emily,Maid of the blasted family,Rose to the God from whom it came!--In Rylstone Church her mortal frameWas buried by her Mother\'s side. Most glorious sunset! and a raySurvives--the twilight of this day--In that fair Creature whom the fieldsSupport, and whom the forest shields;Who, having filled a holy place,Partakes, in her degree, Heaven\'s grace;And bears a memory and a mindRaised far above the law of kind;Haunting the spots with lonely cheerWhich her dear Mistress once held dear: Loves most what Emily loved most--The enclosure of this churchyard ground;Here wanders like a gliding ghost,And every sabbath here is found;Comes with the people when the bellsAre heard among the moorland dells,Finds entrance through yon arch, where wayLies open on the sabbath-day;Here walks amid the mournful wasteOf prostrate altars, shrines defaced, And floors encumbered with rich showOf fret-work imagery laid low;Paces softly, or makes halt,By fractured cell, or tomb, or vault;By plate of monumental brassDim-gleaming among weeds and grass,And sculptured Forms of Warriors brave:But chiefly by that single grave,That one sequestered hillock green,The pensive visitant is seen. There doth the gentle Creature lieWith those adversities unmoved;Calm spectacle, by earth and skyIn their benignity approved!And aye, methinks, this hoary Pile,Subdued by outrage and decay,Looks down upon her with a smile,A gracious smile, that seems to say--\'Thou, thou art not a Child of Time,But Daughter of the Eternal Prime!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Recluse  -  Book First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHOME AT GRASMEREONCE to the verge of yon steep barrier cameA roving school-boy; what the adventurer\'s ageHath now escaped his memory--but the hour,One of a golden summer holiday,He well remembers, though the year be gone--Alone and devious from afar he came;And, with a sudden influx overpoweredAt sight of this seclusion, he forgotHis haste, for hasty had his footsteps beenAs boyish his pursuits; and sighing said, \'What happy fortune were it here to live!And, if a thought of dying, if a thoughtOf mortal separation, could intrudeWith paradise before him, here to die!\'No Prophet was he, had not even a hope,Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,A fancy in the heart of what might beThe lot of others, never could be his.The station whence he looked was soft and green,Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth Of vale below, a height of hills above.For rest of body perfect was the spot,All that luxurious nature could desire;But stirring to the spirit; who could gazeAnd not feel motions there? He thought of cloudsThat sail on winds: of breezes that delightTo play on water, or in endless chasePursue each other through the yielding plainOf grass or corn, over and through and through,In billow after billow, evermore Disporting--nor unmindful was the boyOf sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds;Of fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays,Genii, and winged angels that are LordsWithout restraint of all which they behold.The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he feltThat such unfettered liberty was his,Such power and joy; but only for this end,To flit from field to rock, from rock to field,From shore to island, and from isle to shore, From open ground to covert, from a bedOf meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood;From high to low, from low to high, yet stillWithin the bound of this huge concave; hereMust be his home, this valley be his world.Since that day forth the Place to him--\'to me\'(For I who live to register the truthWas that same young and happy Being) becameAs beautiful to thought, as it had beenWhen present, to the bodily sense; a haunt Of pure affections, shedding upon joyA brighter joy; and through such damp and gloomOf the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youthMistakes for sorrow, darting beams of lightThat no self-cherished sadness could withstand;And now \'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,Beloved Grasmere (let the wandering streamsTake up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name)One of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home.And was the cost so great? and could it seem An act of courage, and the thing itselfA conquest? who must bear the blame? Sage manThy prudence, thy experience, thy desires,Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.Yes the realities of life so cold,So cowardly, so ready to betray,So stinted in the measure of their graceAs we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,Have been to me more bountiful than hope,Less timid than desire--but that is past. On Nature\'s invitation do I come,By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead,That made the calmest fairest spot of earthWith all its unappropriated goodMy own; and not mine only, for with meEntrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,A younger Orphan of a home extinct,The only Daughter of my Parents dwells.Ay, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir, Pause upon that and let the breathing frameNo longer breathe, but all be satisfied.--Oh, if such silence be not thanks to GodFor what hath been bestowed, then where, where thenShall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne\'erFix on a lovely object, nor my mindTake pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,But either She whom now I have, who nowDivides with me this loved abode, was there,Or not far off. Where\'er my footsteps turned, Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,The thought of her was like a flash of light,Or an unseen companionship, a breathOf fragrance independent of the Wind.In all my goings, in the new and oldOf all my meditations, and in thisFavourite of all, in this the most of all.--What being, therefore, since the birth of ManHad ever more abundant cause to speakThanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse Make him more thankful, then to call on VerseTo aid him and in song resound his joy?The boon is absolute; surpassing graceTo me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowersOf blissful Eden this was neither givenNor could be given, possession of the goodWhich had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,And dear Imaginations realised,Up to their highest measure, yea and more.Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in; Now in the clear and open day I feelYour guardianship; I take it to my heart;\'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.But I would call thee beautiful, for mild,And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou artDear Valley, having in thy face a smileThough peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,Pleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake,Its one green island and its winding shores;The multitude of little rocky hills, Thy Church and cottages of mountain stoneClustered like stars some few, but single most,And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,Or glancing at each other cheerful looksLike separated stars with clouds between.What want we? have we not perpetual streams,Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,And thickets full of songsters, and the voiceOf lordly birds, an unexpected sound Heard now and then from morn to latest eve,Admonishing the man who walks belowOf solitude and silence in the sky?These have we, and a thousand nooks of earthHave also these, but nowhere else is found,Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be foundThe one sensation that is here; \'tis here,Here as it found its way into my heartIn childhood, here as it abides by day,By night, here only; or in chosen minds That take it with them hence, where\'er they go.--\'Tis, but I cannot name it, \'tis the senseOf majesty, and beauty, and repose,A blended holiness of earth and sky,Something that makes this individual spot,This small abiding-place of many men,A termination, and a last retreat,A centre, come from wheresoe\'er you will,A whole without dependence or defect,Made for itself, and happy in itself, Perfect contentment, Unity entire.Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,When hitherward we journeyed side by sideThrough burst of sunshine and through flying showers;Paced the long vales--how long they were--and yetHow fast that length of way was left behind,Wensley\'s rich Vale, and Sedbergh\'s naked heights.The frosty wind, as if to make amendsFor its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,And drove us onward like two ships at sea, Or like two birds, companions in mid-air,Parted and reunited by the blast.Stern was the face of nature; we rejoicedIn that stern countenance, for our souls thence drewA feeling of their strength. The naked trees,The icy brooks, as on we passed, appearedTo question us. \'Whence come ye, to what end?\'They seemed to say, \'What would ye,\' said the shower,\'Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?\'The sunbeam said, \'Be happy.\' When this vale We entered, bright and solemn was the skyThat faced us with a passionate welcoming,And led us to our threshold. Daylight failedInsensibly, and round us gently fellComposing darkness, with a quiet loadOf full contentment, in a little shedDisturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,And wondering at its new inhabitants.It loves us now, this Vale so beautifulBegins to love us! by a sullen storm, Two months unwearied of severest storm,It put the temper of our minds to proof,And found us faithful through the gloom, and heardThe poet mutter his prelusive songsWith cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joyAmong the silence of the woods and hills;Silent to any gladsomeness of soundWith all their shepherds.But the gates of SpringAre opened; churlish winter hath given leaveThat she should entertain for this one day, Perhaps for many genial days to come,His guests, and make them jocund.--They are pleased,But most of all the birds that haunt the floodWith the mild summons; inmates though they beOf Winter\'s household, they keep festivalThis day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;They show their pleasure, and shall I do less?Happier of happy though I be, like themI cannot take possession of the sky,Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there One of a mighty multitude, whose wayIs a perpetual harmony and danceMagnificent. Behold how with a graceOf ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seemInferior to angelical, they prolongTheir curious pastime, shaping in mid-air,And sometimes with ambitious wing that soarsHigh as the level of the mountain tops,A circuit ampler than the lake beneath,Their own domain;--but ever, while intent On tracing and retracing that large round,Their jubilant activity evolvesHundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,Upwards and downwards; progress intricateYet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayedTheir indefatigable flight. \'Tis done,Ten times and more I fancied it had ceased,But lo! the vanished company againAscending, they approach. I hear their wingsFaint, faint at first; and then an eager sound Passed in a moment--and as faint again!They tempt the sun to sport among their plumes;Tempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice,To show them a fair image,--\'tis themselves,Their own fair forms upon the glimmering plainPainted more soft and fair as they descend,Almost to touch,--then up again aloft,Up with a sally and a flash of speed,As if they scorned both resting-place and rest!--This day is a thanksgiving, \'tis a day Of glad emotion and deep quietness;Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,The penetrating bliss; oh surely theseHave felt it, not the happy choirs of spring,Her own peculiar family of loveThat sport among green leaves, a blither train!But two are missing, two, a lonely pairOf milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seenPartaking this day\'s pleasure? From afar They came, to sojourn here in solitude,Choosing this Valley, they who had the choiceOf the whole world. We saw them day by day,Through those two months of unrelenting storm,Conspicuous at the centre of the LakeTheir safe retreat, we knew them well, I guessThat the whole valley knew them; but to usThey were more dear than may be well believed,Not only for their beauty, and their stillAnd placid way of life, and constant love Inseparable, not for these alone,But that \'their\' state so much resembled ours,They having also chosen this abode;They strangers, and we strangers, they a pair,And we a solitary pair like them.They should not have departed; many daysDid I look forth in vain, nor on the wingCould see them, nor in that small open spaceOf blue unfrozen water, where they lodgedAnd lived so long in quiet, side by side. Shall we behold them consecrated friends,Faithful companions, yet another yearSurviving, they for us, and we for them,And neither pair be broken? nay perchanceIt is too late already for such hope;The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,And parted them; or haply both are goneOne death, and that were mercy given to both.Recall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive,Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh Of such inhospitable penaltyInflicted upon confidence so pure.Ah! if I wished to follow where the sightOf all that is before my eyes, the voiceWhich speaks from a presiding spirit here,Would lead me, I should whisper to myself:They who are dwellers in this holy placeMust needs themselves be hallowed, they requireNo benediction from the stranger\'s lips,For they are blessed already; none would give The greeting \'peace be with you\' unto them,For peace they have; it cannot but be theirs,And mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these--\'Their\' healing offices a pure good-willPrecludes, and charity beyond the boundsOf charity--an overflowing love;Not for the creature only, but for allThat is around them; love for everythingWhich in their happy Region they behold!Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought Is passed, we blame it not for having come.--What if I floated down a pleasant stream,And now am landed, and the motion gone,Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the streamIs flowing, and will never cease to flow,And I shall float upon that stream again.By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,Words cannot say how beautiful: then hail,Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,Delightful Valley, habitation fair! And to whatever else of outward formCan give an inward help, can purify,And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,And steal away, and for a while deceiveAnd lap in pleasing rest, and bear us onWithout desire in full complacency,Contemplating perfection absolute,And entertained as in a placid sleep.But not betrayed by tenderness of mindThat feared, or wholly overlooked the truth, Did we come hither, with romantic hopeTo find in midst of so much lovelinessLove, perfect love: of so much majestyA like majestic-frame of mind in thoseWho here abide, the persons like the place.Not from such hope, or aught of such belief,Hath issued any portion of the joyWhich I have felt this day. An awful voice\'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard,Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields, Shout after shout--reiterated whoop,In manner of a bird that takes delightIn answering to itself: or like a houndSingle at chase among the lonely woods,His yell repeating; yet it was in truthA human voice--a spirit of coming night;How solemn when the sky is dark, and earthNot dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snowMade visible, amid a noise of windsAnd bleatings manifold of mountain sheep, Which in that iteration recogniseTheir summons, and are gathering round for food,Devoured with keenness, ere to grove or bankOr rocky bield with patience they retire.That very voice, which, in some timid moodOf superstitious fancy, might have seemedAwful as ever stray demoniac uttered,His steps to govern in the wilderness;Or as the Norman Curfew\'s regular beatTo hearths when first they darkened at the knell: That shepherd\'s voice, it may have reached mine earDebased and under profanation, madeThe ready organ of articulate soundsFrom ribaldry, impiety, or wrath,Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawlsOf some abused Festivity--so be it.I came not dreaming of unruffled life,Untainted manners; born among the hills,Bred also there, I wanted not a scaleTo regulate my hopes; pleased with the good I shrink not from the evil with disgust,Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man,The common creature of the brotherhood,Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,For selfishness and envy and revenge,Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.Yet is it something gained, it is in truthA mighty gain, that Labour here preservesHis rosy face, a servant only here Of the fireside or of the open field,A Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired:That extreme penury is here unknown,And cold and hunger\'s abject wretchednessMortal to body and the heaven-born mind:That they who want are not too great a weightFor those who can relieve; here may the heartBreathe in the air of fellow-sufferingDreadless, as in a kind of fresher breezeOf her own native element, the hand Be ready and unwearied without plea,From tasks too frequent or beyond its power,For languor or indifference or despair.And as these lofty barriers break the forceOf winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in partConceal us from the storm, so here abidesA power and a protection for the mind,Dispensed indeed to other solitudesFavoured by noble privilege like this,Where kindred independence of estate Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,He, happy man! is master of the field,And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod.Not less than halfway up yon mountain\'s side,Behold a dusky spot, a grove of FirsThat seems still smaller than it is; this groveIs haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spiritOf memory faithful to the call of love;For, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends upYon curling smoke from the grey cot below, The trees (her first-born child being then a babe)Were planted by her husband and herself,That ranging o\'er the high and houseless groundTheir sheep might neither want from perilous stormOf winter, nor from summer\'s sultry heat,A friendly covert; \'and they knew it well,\'Said she, \'for thither as the trees grew upWe to the patient creatures carried foodIn times of heavy snow.\' She then beganIn fond obedience to her private thoughts To speak of her dead husband; is there notAn art, a music, and a strain of wordsThat shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life,Shall speak of what is done among the fields,Done truly there, or felt, of solid goodAnd real evil, yet be sweet withal,More grateful, more harmonious than the breath,The idle breath of softest pipe attunedTo pastoral fancies? Is there such a streamPure and unsullied flowing from the heart With motions of true dignity and grace?Or must we seek that stream where Man is not?Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,Delicious as the gentlest breeze that soundsThrough that aerial fir-grove--could preserveSome portion of its human historyAs gathered from the Matron\'s lips, and tellOf tears that have been shed at sight of it,And moving dialogues between this PairWho in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while theyNo longer flourish, he entirely gone,She withering in her loneliness. Be thisA task above my skill--the silent mindHas her own treasures, and I think of these,Love what I see, and honour humankind.No, we are not alone, we do not stand,My sister here misplaced and desolate,Loving what no one cares for but ourselves,We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks Of this fair Vale, and o\'er its spacious heights,Unprofitable kindliness, bestowedOn objects unaccustomed to the giftsOf feeling, which were cheerless and forlornBut few weeks past, and would be so againWere we not here; we do not tend a lampWhose lustre we alone participate,Which shines dependent upon us alone,Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.Look where we will, some human hand has been Before us with its offering; not a treeSprinkles these little pastures, but the sameHath furnished matter for a thought; perchanceFor some one serves as a familiar friend.Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,Home of untutored shepherds as it is,Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deemThese feelings, though subservient more than oursTo every day\'s demand for daily bread, And borrowing more their spirit and their shapeFrom self-respecting interests; deem them notUnworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no,They lift the animal being, do themselvesBy nature\'s kind and ever-present aidRefine the selfishness from which they spring,Redeem by love the individual senseOf anxiousness, with which they are combined.And thus it is that fitly they becomeAssociates in the joy of purest minds: They blend therewith congenially: meanwhileCalmly they breathe their own undying lifeThrough this their mountain sanctuary; longOh long may it remain inviolate,Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,And giving to the moments as they passTheir little boons of animating thoughtThat sweeten labour, make it seen and feltTo be no arbitrary weight imposed,But a glad function natural to man. Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,Already have I gained; the inward frame,Though slowly opening, opens every dayWith process not unlike to that which cheersA pensive stranger journeying at his leisureThrough some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mistsBreak up and are beginning to recede;How pleased he is where thin and thinner growsThe veil, or where it parts at once, to spyThe dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads; To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed;Then to be greeted by the scattered hutsAs they shine out; and \'see\' the streams whose murmurHad soothed his ear while \'they\' were hidden; how pleasedTo have about him which way e\'er he goesSomething on every side concealed from view,In every quarter something visibleHalf seen or wholly, lost and found again,Alternate progress and impediment,And yet a growing prospect in the main. Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,Herein less happy than the Traveller,To cast from time to time a painful lookUpon unwelcome things which unawaresReveal themselves, not therefore is my heartDepressed, nor does it fear what is to come;But confident, enriched at every glance,The more I see the more delight my mindReceives, or by reflection can create:Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?Nor let me pass unheeded other lovesWhere no fear is, and humbler sympathies.Already hath sprung up within my heartA liking for the small grey horse that bearsThe paralytic man, and for the bruteIn Scripture sanctified--the patient bruteOn which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.The famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale, Though yet to me a stranger, will not beA stranger long; nor will the blind man\'s guide,Meek and neglected thing, of no renown!Soon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fadesFriends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrushTo rouse me, and a hundred warblers more!And if those Eagles to their ancient holdReturn, Helvellyn\'s Eagles! with the PairFrom my own door I shall be free to claimAcquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud. The owl that gives the name to Owlet-CragHave I heard whooping, and he soon will beA chosen one of my regards. See thereThe heifer in yon little croft belongsTo one who holds it dear; with duteous careShe reared it, and in speaking of her chargeI heard her scatter some endearing wordsDomestic, and in spirit motherly,She being herself a mother; happy Beast,If the caresses of a human voice Can make it so, and care of human hands.And ye as happy under Nature\'s care,Strangers to me and all men, or at leastStrangers to all particular amity,All intercourse of knowledge or of loveThat parts the individual from his kind.Whether in large communities ye keepFrom year to year, not shunning man\'s abode,A settled residence, or be from farWild creatures, and of many homes, that come The gift of winds, and whom the winds againTake from us at your pleasure; yet shall yeNot want for this your own subordinate placeIn my affections. Witness the delightWith which erewhile I saw that multitudeWheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,Yet not at rest upon the glassy lake:They \'cannot\' rest--they gambol like young whelps;Active as lambs, and overcome with joyThey try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge, And beat the passive water with their wings.Too distant are they for plain view, but lo!Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun,Betray their occupation, rising upFirst one and then another silver spout,As one or other takes the fit of glee,Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guiseOf plaything fireworks, that on festal nightsSparkle about the feet of wanton boys.--How vast the compass of this theatre, Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pompAnd silent majesty; the birch-tree woodsAre hung with thousand thousand diamond dropsOf melted hoar-frost, every tiny knotIn the bare twigs, each little budding-placeCased with its several beads; what myriads theseUpon one tree, while all the distant grove,That rises to the summit of the steep,Shows like a mountain built of silver light:See yonder the same pageant, and again Behold the universal imageryInverted, all its sun-bright features touchedAs with the varnish and the gloss of dreams.Dreamlike the blending also of the wholeHarmonious landscape: all along the shoreThe boundary lost--the line invisibleThat parts the image from reality;And the clear hills, as high as they ascendHeavenward, so deep piercing the lake below.Admonished of the days of love to come The raven croaks, and fills the upper airWith a strange sound of genial harmony;And in and all about that playful band,Incapable although they be of rest,And in their fashion very rioters,There is a stillness, and they seem to makeCalm revelry in that their calm abode.Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass,Pass with a thought the life of the whole yearThat is to come: the throng of woodland flowers And lilies that will dance upon the waves.Say boldly then that solitude is notWhere these things are: he truly is alone,He of the multitude whose eyes are doomedTo hold a vacant commerce day by dayWith Objects wanting life--repelling love;He by the vast metropolis immured,Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls,Where numbers overwhelm humanity,And neighbourhood serves rather to divide Than to unite--what sighs more deep than his,Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;Who must inhabit under a black skyA city, where, if indifference to disgustYield not to scorn or sorrow, living menAre ofttimes to their fellow-men no moreThan to the forest Hermit are the leavesThat hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less,For they protect his walk from sun and shower,Swell his devotion with their voice in storms, And whisper while the stars twinkle among themHis lullaby. From crowded streets remote,Far from the living and dead WildernessOf the thronged world, Society is hereA true community--a genuine frameOf many into one incorporate.\'That\' must be looked for here: paternal sway,One household, under God, for high and low,One family and one mansion; to themselvesAppropriate, and divided from the world, As if it were a cave, a multitudeHuman and brute, possessors undisturbedOf this Recess--their legislative Hall,Their Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place.Dismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams,All golden fancies of the golden age,The bright array of shadowy thoughts from timesThat were before all time, or are to beEre time expire, the pageantry that stirsOr will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed On lovely objects, and we wish to partWith all remembrance of a jarring world,--Take we at once this one sufficient hope,What need of more? that we shall neither droopNor pine for want of pleasure in the lifeScattered about us, nor through want of aughtThat keeps in health the insatiable mind.--That we shall have for knowledge and for loveAbundance, and that feeling as we doHow goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure From all reproach is yon ethereal vault,And this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart,By which and under which we are enclosedTo breathe in peace; we shall moreover find(If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,If rightly we observe and justly weigh)The inmates not unworthy of their home,The Dwellers of their Dwelling.And if thisWere otherwise, we have within ourselvesEnough to fill the present day with joy, And overspread the future years with hope,Our beautiful and quiet home, enrichedAlready with a stranger whom we loveDeeply, a stranger of our Father\'s house,A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,Who finds at last an hour to his contentBeneath our roof. And others whom we loveWill seek us also, Sisters of our hearts,And one, like them, a Brother of our hearts,Philosopher and Poet, in whose sight These mountains will rejoice with open joy.--Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we areAnd must be, with God\'s will, a happy Band.Yet \'tis not to enjoy that we exist,For that end only; something must be done:I must not walk in unreproved delightThese narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,No duty that looks further, and no care.Each Being has his office, lowly someAnd common, yet all worthy if fulfilled With zeal, acknowledgment that with the giftKeeps pace a harvest answering to the seed.Of ill-advised Ambition and of PrideI would stand clear, but yet to me I feelThat an internal brightness is vouchsafedThat must not die, that must not pass away.Why does this inward lustre fondly seekAnd gladly blend with outward fellowship?Why do \'they\' shine around me whom I love?Why do they teach me, whom I thus revere? Strange question, yet it answers not itself.That humble Roof embowered among the trees,That calm fireside, it is not even in them,Blest as they are, to furnish a replyThat satisfies and ends in perfect rest.Possessions have I that are solely mine,Something within which yet is shared by none,Not even the nearest to me and most dear,Something which power and effort may impart;I would impart it, I would spread it wide: Immortal in the world which is to come--Forgive me if I add another claim--And would not wholly perish even in this,Lie down and be forgotten in the dust,I and the modest Partners of my daysMaking a silent company in death;Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights,All buried with me without monumentOr profit unto any but ourselves!It must not be, if I, divinely taught, Be privileged to speak as I have feltOf what in man is human or divine.While yet an innocent little one, with a heartThat doubtless wanted not its tender moods,I breathed (for this I better recollect)Among wild appetites and blind desires,Motions of savage instinct my delightAnd exaltation. Nothing at that timeSo welcome, no temptation half so dearAs that which urged me to a daring feat, Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,And tottering towers: I loved to stand and readTheir looks forbidding, read and disobey,Sometimes in act and evermore in thought.With impulses, that scarcely were by theseSurpassed in strength, I heard of danger metOr sought with courage; enterprise forlornBy one, sole keeper of his own intent,Or by a resolute few, who for the sakeOf glory fronted multitudes in arms. Yea, to this hour I cannot read a TaleOf two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,And fighting to the death, but I am pleasedMore than a wise man ought to be; I wish,Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there.But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seekFor other agitations, or be calm;Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,Some nursling of the mountains which she leadsThrough quiet meadows, after he has learnt His strength, and had his triumph and his joy,His desperate course of tumult and of glee.That which in stealth by Nature was performedHath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate VoiceHath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things,Thy glory and thy happiness be there.Nor fear, though thou confide in me, a wantOf aspirations that have been--of foesTo wrestle with, and victory to complete,Bounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored; All that inflamed thy infant heart, the love,The longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest,All shall survive, though changed their office, allShall live, it is not in their power to die.Then farewell to the Warrior\'s Schemes, farewellThe forwardness of soul which looks that wayUpon a less incitement than the CauseOf Liberty endangered, and farewellThat other hope, long mine, the hope to fillThe heroic trumpet with the Muse\'s breath! Yet in this peaceful Vale we will not spendUnheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought,A voice shall speak, and what will be the theme?On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life,Musing in solitude, I oft perceiveFair trains of imagery before me rise,Accompanied by feelings of delightPure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed;And I am conscious of affecting thoughtsAnd dear remembrances, whose presence soothes Or elevates the Mind, intent to weighThe good and evil of our mortal state.--To these emotions, whencesoe\'er they come,Whether from breath of outward circumstance,Or from the Soul--an impulse to herself--I would give utterance in numerous verse.Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope,And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith;Of blessed consolations in distress;Of moral strength, and intellectual Power; Of joy in widest commonalty spread;Of the individual Mind that keeps her ownInviolate retirement, subject thereTo Conscience only, and the law supremeOf that Intelligence which governs all--I sing:--\'fit audience let me find though few!\'So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--In holiest mood. Urania, I shall needThy guidance, or a greater Muse, if suchDescend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!

For all--all dying in one hour!--Why comes not Francis? Thoughts of loveShould bear him to his Sister dearWith the fleet motion of a dove;Yea, like a heavenly messengerOf speediest wing, should he appear.Why comes he not?--for westward fastAlong the plain of York he past;Reckless of what impels or leads,Unchecked he hurries on;--nor heeds The sorrow, through the Villages,Spread by triumphant crueltiesOf vengeful military force,And punishment without remorse.He marked not, heard not, as he fledAll but the suffering heart was deadFor him abandoned to blank awe,To vacancy, and horror strong:And the first object which he saw,With conscious sight, as he swept along-- It was the Banner in his hand!He felt--and made a sudden stand.He looked about like one betrayed:What hath he done? what promise made?Oh weak, weak moment! to what endCan such a vain oblation tend,And he the Bearer?--Can he goCarrying this instrument of woe,And find, find anywhere, a rightTo excuse him in his Country\'s sight? No; will not all men deem the changeA downward course, perverse and strange?Here is it;--but how? when? must she,The unoffending Emily,Again this piteous object see?Such conflict long did he maintain,Nor liberty nor rest could gain:His own life into danger broughtBy this sad burden--even that thought,Exciting self-suspicion strong Swayed the brave man to his wrong.And how--unless it were the senseOf all-disposing Providence,Its will unquestionably shown--How has the Banner clung so fastTo a palsied, and unconscious hand;Clung to the hand to which it passedWithout impediment? And why,But that Heaven\'s purpose might be known,Doth now no hindrance meet his eye, No intervention, to withstandFulfilment of a Father\'s prayerBreathed to a Son forgiven, and blestWhen all resentments were at rest,And life in death laid the heart bare?--Then, like a spectre sweeping by,Rushed through his mind the prophecyOf utter desolation madeTo Emily in the yew-tree shade:He sighed, submitting will and power To the stern embrace of that grasping hour.\'No choice is left, the deed is mine--Dead are they, dead!--and I will go,And, for their sakes, come weal or woe,Will lay the Relic on the shrine.\'So forward with a steady willHe went, and traversed plain and hill;And up the vale of Wharf his wayPursued;--and, at the dawn of day,Attained a summit whence his eyes Could see the Tower of Bolton rise.There Francis for a moment\'s spaceMade halt--but hark! a noise behindOf horsemen at an eager pace!He heard, and with misgiving mind.--\'Tis Sir George Bowes who leads the Band:They come, by cruel Sussex sent;Who, when the Nortons from the handOf death had drunk their punishment,Bethought him, angry and ashamed, How Francis, with the Banner claimedAs his own charge, had disappeared,By all the standers-by revered.His whole bold carriage (which had quelledThus far the Opposer, and repelledAll censure, enterprise so brightThat even bad men had vainly strivenAgainst that overcoming light)Was then reviewed, and prompt word given,That to what place soever fled He should be seized, alive or dead.The troop of horse have gained the heightWhere Francis stood in open sight.They hem him round--\'Behold the proof,\'They cried, \'the Ensign in his hand!\'He\' did not arm, he walked aloof!For why?--to save his Father\'s land;--Worst Traitor of them all is he,A Traitor dark and cowardly!\'\'I am no Traitor,\' Francis said, \'Though this unhappy freight I bear;And must not part with.

\'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,And Benjamin, without a question,Taking her for some way-worn rover,Said, \'Mount, and get you under cover!\'Another voice, in tone as hoarseAs a swoln brook with rugged course,Cried out, \'Good brother, why so fast?I\'ve had a glimpse of you--\'avast!\'Or, since it suits you to be civil,Take her at once--for good and evil!\' \'It is my Husband,\' softly saidThe Woman, as if half afraid:By this time she was snug within,Through help of honest Benjamin;She and her Babe, which to her breastWith thankfulness the Mother pressed;And now the same strong voice more nearSaid cordially, \'My Friend, what cheer?Rough doings these!

The past he calmly hath reviewed:But where will be the fortitudeOf this brave man, when he shall seeThat Form beneath the spreading tree,And know that it is Emily?He saw her where in open viewShe sate beneath the spreading yew--Her head upon her lap, concealingIn solitude her bitter feeling:\'Might ever son \'command\' a sire, The act were justified to-day.\'This to himself--and to the Maid,Whom now he had approached, he said--\'Gone are they,--they have their desire;And I with thee one hour will stay,To give thee comfort if I may.\'She heard, but looked not up, nor spake;And sorrow moved him to partakeHer silence; then his thoughts turned round,And fervent words a passage found. \'Gone are they, bravely, though misled;With a dear Father at their head!The Sons obey a natural lord;The Father had given solemn wordTo noble Percy; and a forceStill stronger, bends him to his course.This said, our tears to-day may fallAs at an innocent funeral.In deep and awful channel runsThis sympathy of Sire and Sons; Untried our Brothers have been lovedWith heart by simple nature moved;And now their faithfulness is proved:For faithful we must call them, bearingThat soul of conscientious daring.--There were they all in circle--thereStood Richard, Ambrose, Christopher,John with a sword that will not fail,And Marmaduke in fearless mail,And those bright Twins were side by side; And there, by fresh hopes beautified,Stood He, whose arm yet lacks the powerOf man, our youngest, fairest flower!I, by the right of eldest born,And in a second father\'s place,Presumed to grapple with their scorn,And meet their pity face to face;Yea, trusting in God\'s holy aid,I to my Father knelt and prayed;And one, the pensive Marmaduke, Methought, was yielding inwardly,And would have laid his purpose by,But for a glance of his Father\'s eye,Which I myself could scarcely brook.Then be we, each and all, forgiven!Thou, chiefly thou, my Sister dear,Whose pangs are registered in heaven--The stifled sigh, the hidden tear,And smiles, that dared to take their place,Meek filial smiles, upon thy face, As that unhallowed Banner grewBeneath a loving old Man\'s view.Thy part is done--thy painful part;Be thou then satisfied in heart!A further, though far easier, taskThan thine hath been, my duties ask;With theirs my efforts cannot blend,I cannot for such cause contend;Their aims I utterly forswear;But I in body will be there.

Then, in the turbulence of glee,And in the excess of amity,Says Benjamin, \'That Ass of thine,He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:If he were tethered to the waggon,He\'d drag as well what he is dragging,And we, as brother should with brother,Might trudge it alongside each other!\'Forthwith, obedient to command,The horses made a quiet stand; And to the waggon\'s skirts was tiedThe Creature, by the Mastiff\'s side,The Mastiff wondering, and perplextWith dread of what will happen next;And thinking it but sorry cheer,To have such company so near!This new arrangement made, the WainThrough the still night proceeds again;No Moon hath risen her light to lend;But indistinctly may be kenned The VANGUARD, following close behind,Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!\'Thy wife and child are snug and warm,Thy ship will travel without harm;I like,\' said Benjamin, \'her shape and stature:And this of mine--this bulky creatureOf which I have the steering--this,Seen fairly, is not much amiss!We want your streamers, friend, you know;But, altogether as we go, We make a kind of handsome show!Among these hills, from first to last,We\'ve weathered many a furious blast;Hard passage forcing on, with headAgainst the storm, and canvas spread.I hate a boaster; but to theeWill say\'t, who know\'st both land and sea,The unluckiest hulk that stems the brineIs hardly worse beset than mine,When cross-winds on her quarter beat; And, fairly lifted from my feet,I stagger onward--heaven knows how;But not so pleasantly as now:Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,And many a foundrous pit surrounded!Yet here we are, by night and dayGrinding through rough and smooth our way;Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;And long shall be so yet--God willing!\'\'Ay,\' said the Tar, \'through fair and foul-- But save us from yon screeching owl!\'That instant was begun a frayWhich called their thoughts another way:The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!What must he do but growl and snarl,Still more and more dissatisfiedWith the meek comrade at his side!Till, not incensed though put to proof,The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,Salutes the Mastiff on the head; And so were better manners bred,And all was calmed and quieted.\'Yon screech-owl,\' says the Sailor, turningBack to his former cause of mourning,\'Yon owl!--pray God that all be well!\'Tis worse than any funeral bell;As sure as I\'ve the gift of sight,We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!\'--Said Benjamin, \'This whip shall layA thousand, if they cross our way. I know that Wanton\'s noisy station,I know him and his occupation;The jolly bird hath learned his cheerUpon the banks of Windermere;Where a tribe of them make merry,Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;Hallooing from an open throat,Like travellers shouting for a boat.--The tricks he learned at WindermereThis vagrant owl is playing here-- That is the worst of his employment:He\'s at the top of his enjoyment!\'This explanation stilled the alarm,Cured the foreboder like a charm;This, and the manner, and the voice,Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;His heart is up--he fears no evilFrom life or death, from man or devil;He wheels--and, making many stops,Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops; And, while he talked of blows and scars,Benjamin, among the stars,Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;Such retreating and advancingAs, I ween, was never seenIn bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Mary\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLet other bards of angels sing, Bright suns without a spot; But thou art no such perfect thing: Rejoice that thou art not!

then thus he cried,When I the process have in memory,How thou hast wearied me on every side,Men thence a book might make, a history; What need to seek a conquest over me, Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy Hast thou thy own liege subjects to destroy? Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ireWell hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief.Now mercy, Lord! thou know\'st well I desireThy grace above all pleasures first and chief;And live and die I will in thy belief;For which I ask for guerdon but one boon,That Cresida again thou send me soon.Constrain her heart as quickly to return,As thou dost mine with longing her to see,Then know I well that she would not sojourn. Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not beUnto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee,As Juno was unto the Theban blood,From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.And after this he to the gate did go,Whence Cresid rode, as if in haste she was;And up and down there went, and to and fro,And to himself full oft he said, alas!From hence my hope, and solace forth did pass.O would the blissful God now for his joy, I might her see again coming to Troy!And up to yonder hill was I her guide;Alas, and there I took of her my leave;Yonder I saw her to her Father ride,For very grief of which my heart shall cleave;--And hither home I came when it was eve;And here I dwell an outcast from all joy,And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy.And of himself did he imagine oft,That he was blighted, pale, and waxen less Than he was wont; and that in whispers softMen said, what may it be, can no one guessWhy Troilus hath all this heaviness?All which he of himself conceited whollyOut of his weakness and his melancholy.Another time he took into his head,That every wight, who in the way passed by,Had of him ruth, and fancied that they said,I am right sorry Troilus will die:And thus a day or two drove wearily; As ye have heard; such life \'gan he to leadAs one that standeth betwixt hope and dread.For which it pleased him in his songs to showThe occasion of his woe, as best he might;And made a fitting song, of words but few,Somewhat his woeful heart to make more light;And when he was removed from all men\'s sight,With a soft night voice, he of his Lady dear,That absent was, \'gan sing as ye may hear.O star, of which I lost have all the light, With a sore heart well ought I to bewail,That ever dark in torment, night by night,Toward my death with wind I steer and sail;For which upon the tenth night if thou failWith thy bright beams to guide me but one hour,My ship and me Charybdis will devour.As soon as he this song had thus sung through,He fell again into his sorrows old;And every night, as was his wont to do,Troilus stood the bright moon to behold; And all his trouble to the moon he told,And said; I wis, when thou art horn\'d anew,I shall be glad if all the world be true.Thy horns were old as now upon that morrow,When hence did journey my bright Lady dear,That cause is of my torment and my sorrow;For which, oh, gentle Luna, bright and clear;For love of God, run fast above thy sphere;For when thy horns begin once more to spring,Then shall she come, that with her bliss may bring. The day is more, and longer every nightThan they were wont to be---for he thought so;And that the sun did take his course not right,By longer way than he was wont to go;And said, I am in constant dread I trow,That Phaeton his son is yet alive,His too fond father\'s car amiss to drive.Upon the walls fast also would he walk,To the end that he the Grecian host might see;And ever thus he to himself would talk:-- Lo! yonder is my own bright Lady free;Or yonder is it that the tents must be;And thence does come this air which is so sweet,That in my soul I feel the joy of it.And certainly this wind, that more and moreBy moments thus increaseth in my face,Is of my Lady\'s sighs heavy and sore;I prove it thus; for in no other spaceOf all this town, save only in this place,Feel I a wind, that soundeth so like pain; It saith, Alas, why severed are we twain?A weary while in pain he tosseth thus,Till fully past and gone was the ninth night;And ever at his side stood Pandarus,Who busily made use of all his mightTo comfort him, and make his heart more light;Giving him always hope, that she the morrowOf the tenth day will come, and end his sorrow.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nView From The Top Of Black Comb\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHIS Height a ministering Angel might select:For from the summit of BLACK COMB (dread nameDerived from clouds and storms!) the amplest rangeOf unobstructed prospect may be seenThat British ground commands:--low dusky tracts,Where Trent is nursed, far southward!

All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink On its firm margin, even as from a well, Or some stone-basin which the herdsman\'s hand Had shaped for their refreshment; nor did sun, Or wind from any quarter, ever come, But as a blessing to this calm recess, This glade of water and this one green field. The spot was made by Nature for herself; The travellers know it not, and \'twill remain Unknown to them; but it is beautiful; And if a man should plant his cottage near, Should sleep beneath the shelter of its trees, And blend its waters with his daily meal, He would so love it, that in his death-hour Its image would survive among his thoughts: And therefore, my sweet MARY, this still Nook, With all its beeches, we have named from You!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThose Words Were Uttered As In Pensive Mood\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHOSE words were uttered as in pensive moodWe turned, departing from that solemn sight:A contrast and reproach to gross delight,And life\'s unspiritual pleasures daily wooed!But now upon this thought I cannot brood;It is unstable as a dream of night;Nor will I praise a cloud, however bright,Disparaging Man\'s gifts, and proper food.Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome,Though clad in colours beautiful and pure, Find in the heart of man no natural home:The immortal Mind craves objects that endure:These cleave to it; from these it cannot roam,Nor they from it: their fellowship is secure.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo A Young Lady Who Had Been Reproached For Taking Long Walks In The Country\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDEAR Child of Nature, let them rail!--There is a nest in a green dale,A harbour and a hold;Where thou, a Wife and Friend, shalt seeThy own heart-stirring days, and beA light to young and old.There, healthy as a shepherd boy,And treading among flowers of joyWhich at no season fade,Thou, while thy babes around thee cling, Shalt show us how divine a thingA Woman may be made.Thy thoughts and feelings shall not die,Nor leave thee, when grey hairs are nigh,A melancholy slave;But an old age serene and bright,And lovely as a Lapland night,Shall lead thee to thy grave.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Force Of Prayer, Or, The Founding Of Bolton, A Tradition\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'What is good for a bootless bene?\'With these dark words begins my Tale;And their meaning is, whence can comfort springWhen Prayer is of no avail?\'What is good for a bootless bene?\'The Falconer to the Lady said;And she made answer \'ENDLESS SORROW!\'For she knew that her Son was dead.She knew it by the Falconer\'s words,And from the look of the Falconer\'s eye; And from the love which was in her soulFor her youthful Romilly.--Young Romilly through Barden woodsIs ranging high and low;And holds a greyhound in a leash,To let slip upon buck or doe.The pair have reached that fearful chasm,How tempting to bestride!For lordly Wharf is there pent inWith rocks on either side. This striding-place is called THE STRID,A name which it took of yore:A thousand years hath it borne that name,And shall a thousand more.And hither is young Romilly come,And what may now forbidThat he, perhaps for the hundredth time,Shall bound across THE STRID?He sprang in glee,--for what cared heThat the river was strong, and the rocks were steep?-- But the greyhound in the leash hung back,And checked him in his leap.The Boy is in the arms of Wharf,And strangled by a merciless force;For never more was young Romilly seenTill he rose a lifeless corse.Now there is stillness in the vale,And long, unspeaking, sorrow:Wharf shall be to pitying heartsA name more sad than Yarrow. If for a lover the Lady wept,A solace she might borrowFrom death, and from the passion of death;--Old Wharf might heal her sorrow.She weeps not for the wedding-dayWhich was to be to-morrow:Her hope was a further-looking hope,And hers is a mother\'s sorrow.He was a tree that stood alone,And proudly did its branches wave; And the root of this delightful treeWas in her husband\'s grave!Long, long in darkness did she sit,And her first words were, \'Let there beIn Bolton, on the field of Wharf,A stately Priory!\'The stately Priory was reared;And Wharf, as he moved along,To matins joined a mournful voice,Nor failed at evensong. And the Lady prayed in heavinessThat looked not for relief!But slowly did her succour come,And a patience to her grief.Oh! there is never sorrow of heartThat shall lack a timely end,If but to God we turn, and askOf Him to be our friend!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Horn Of Egremont Castle\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nERE the Brothers through the gatewayIssued forth with old and young,To the Horn Sir Eustace pointedWhich for ages there had hung.Horn it was which none could sound,No one upon living ground,Save He who came as rightful HeirTo Egremont\'s Domains and Castle fair.Heirs from times of earliest recordHad the House of Lucie born, Who of right had held the LordshipClaimed by proof upon the Horn:Each at the appointed hourTried the Horn,--it owned his power;He was acknowledged: and the blast,Which good Sir Eustace sounded, was the last.With his lance Sir Eustace pointed,And to Hubert thus said he,\'What I speak this Horn shall witnessFor thy better memory.

Side by side they fought (the LuciesWere a line for valour famed),And where\'er their strokes alighted,There the Saracens were tamed.Whence, then, could it come--the thought--By what evil spirit brought?Oh! can a brave Man wish to takeHis Brother\'s life, for Lands\' and Castle\'s sake?\'Sir!\' the Ruffians said to Hubert,\'Deep he lies in Jordan flood.\' Stricken by this ill assurance,Pale and trembling Hubert stood.\'Take your earnings.\'--Oh! that ICould have \'seen\' my Brother die!It was a pang that vexed him then;And oft returned, again, and yet again.Months passed on, and no Sir Eustace!Nor of him were tidings heard;Wherefore, bold as day, the MurdererBack again to England steered. To his Castle Hubert sped;Nothing has he now to dread.But silent and by stealth he came,And at an hour which nobody could name.None could tell if it were night-time,Night or day, at even or morn;No one\'s eye had seen him enter,No one\'s ear had heard the Horn.But bold Hubert lives in glee:Months and years went smilingly; With plenty was his table spread;And bright the Lady is who shares his bed.Likewise he had sons and daughters;And, as good men do, he sateAt his board by these surrounded,Flourishing in fair estate.And while thus in open dayOnce he sate, as old books say,A blast was uttered from the Horn,Where by the Castle-gate it hung forlorn. \'Tis the breath of good Sir Eustace!He is come to claim his right:Ancient castle, woods, and mountainsHear the challenge with delight.Hubert! though the blast be blownHe is helpless and alone:Thou hast a dungeon, speak the word!And there he may be lodged, and thou be Lord.Speak!--astounded Hubert cannot;And, if power to speak he had, All are daunted, all the householdSmitten to the heart, and sad.\'Tis Sir Eustace; if it beLiving man, it must be he!Thus Hubert thought in his dismay,And by a postern-gate he slunk away.Long, and long was he unheard of:To his Brother then he came,Made confession, asked forgiveness,Asked it by a brother\'s name, And by all the saints in heaven;And of Eustace was forgiven:Then in a convent went to hideHis melancholy head, and there he died.But Sir Eustace, whom good angelsHad preserved from murderers\' hands,And from Pagan chains had rescued,Lived with honour on his lands.Sons he had, saw sons of theirs:And through ages, heirs of heirs, A long posterity renowned,Sounded the Horn which they alone could sound.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Idle Shepherd Boys\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe valley rings with mirth and joy;Among the hills the echoes playA never never ending song,To welcome in the May.The magpie chatters with delight;The mountain raven\'s youngling broodHave left the mother and the nest;And they go rambling east and westIn search of their own food;Or through the glittering vapors dartIn very wantonness of heart.Beneath a rock, upon the grass,Two boys are sitting in the sun;Their work, if any work they have,Is out of mind---or done.On pipes of sycamore they playThe fragments of a Christmas hymn;Or with that plant which in our daleWe call stag-horn, or fox\'s tail,Their rusty hats they trim:And thus, as happy as the day,Those Shepherds wear the time away.Along the river\'s stony margeThe sand-lark chants a joyous song;The thrush is busy in the wood,And carols loud and strong.A thousand lambs are on the rocks,All newly born! both earth and skyKeep jubilee, and more than all,Those boys with their green coronal;They never hear the cry,That plaintive cry! which up the hillComes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.Said Walter, leaping from the ground,\'Down to the stump of yon old yewWe\'ll for our whistles run a race.\'Away the shepherds flew;They leapt---they ran---and when they cameRight opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll,Seeing that he should lose the prize,\'Stop! \' to his comrade Walter cries---James stopped with no good will:Said Walter then, exulting; \'HereYou\'ll find a task for half a year.Cross, if you dare, where I shall cross---Come on, and tread where I shall tread.\'The other took him at his word,And followed as he led.It was a spot which you may seeIf ever you to Langdale go;Into a chasm a mighty blockHath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:The gulf is deep below;And, in a basin black and small,Receives a lofty waterfall.With staff in hand across the cleftThe challenger pursued his march;And now, all eyes and feet, hath gainedThe middle of the arch.When list! he hears a piteous moan---Again !---his heart within him dies---His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,He totters, pallid as a ghost,And, looking down, espiesA lamb, that in the pool is pentWithin that black and frightful rent.The lamb had slipped into the stream,And safe without a bruise or woundThe cataract had borne him downInto the gulf profound.His dam had seen him when he fell,She saw him down the torrent borne;And, while with all a mother\'s loveShe from the lofty rocks aboveSent forth a cry forlorn,The lamb, still swimming round and round,Made answer to that plaintive sound.When he had learnt what thing it was,That sent this rueful cry; I weenThe Boy recovered heart, and toldThe sight which he had seen.Both gladly now deferred their task;Nor was there wanting other aid---A Poet, one who loves the brooksFar better than the sages\' books,By chance had thither stra'
