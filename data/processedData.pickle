S'Descriptive Sketches Taken During A Pedestrian Tour Among The Alps\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWERE there, below, a spot of holy ground      Where from distress a refuge might be found,      And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;       Sure, nature\'s God that spot to man had given      Where falls the purple morning far and wide      In flakes of light upon the mountain side;       Where with loud voice the power of water shakes      The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.        Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,      Who at the call of summer quits his home,         And plods through some wide realm o\'er vale and height,      Though seeking only holiday delight;       At least, not owning to himself an aim      To which the sage would give a prouder name.      No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,      Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;       Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,      Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.      For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn;       And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!           Dear is the forest frowning o\'er his head,      And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:      Moves there a cloud o\'er mid-day\'s flaming eye?       Upward he looks- \'and calls it luxury:\'      Kind Nature\'s charities his steps attend;       In every babbling brook he finds a friend;       While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed      By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.      Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,      To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;         He views the sun uplift his golden fire,      Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon\'s lyre;       Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,      To light him shaken by his rugged way.      Back from his sight no bashful children steal;       He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;       His humble looks no shy restraint impart;       Around him plays at will the virgin heart.      While unsuspended wheels the village dance,      The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,           Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,      Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.        A hope, that prudence could not then approve,      That clung to Nature with a truant\'s love,      O\'er Gallia\'s wastes of corn my footsteps led;       Her files of road-elms, high above my head      In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;       Or where her pathways straggle as they please      By lonely farms and secret villages.      But lo! the Alps ascending white in air,            Toy with the sun and glitter from afar.        And now, emerging from the forest\'s gloom,      I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom.      Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe      Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear?       \'That\' Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound,      Chains that were loosened only by the sound      Of holy rites chanted in measured round?       - The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms,      The cloister startles at the gleam of arms.       The thundering tube the aged angler hears,      Bent o\'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.      Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,      Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o\'erspreads;       Strong terror checks the female peasant\'s sighs,      And start the astonished shades at female eyes.      From Bruno\'s forest screams the affrighted jay,      And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.      A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock      The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock.       The \'parting Genius\' sighs with hollow breath      Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.      Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds      Portentous through her old woods\' trackless bounds,      Vallombre, \'mid her falling fanes, deplores,      For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.        More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves      Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.      No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps      Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.         - To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,      From ringing team apart and grating wain-       To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water\'s bound,      Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,      Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,      And o\'er the whitened wave their shadows fling-       The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;       And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.      The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees      From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;          Or marks, \'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids      Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;       Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view      Stretch o\'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,      And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,      As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.      Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed      In golden light; half hides itself in shade:      While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,      Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire:       There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw      Rich golden verdure on the lake below.      Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,      And steals into the shade the lazy oar;       Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,      And amorous music on the water dies.      How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets      Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;       Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales      Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales;             Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,      Each with its household boat beside the door;       Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;       Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows\' nests, on high;       That glimmer hoar in eve\'s last light, descried      Dim from the twilight water\'s shaggy side,      Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods      Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;       Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,      \'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning\'s ray           Slow-travelling down the western hills, to enfold      Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;       Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell      Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,      And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass      Along the steaming lake, to early mass.      But now farewell to each and all- adieu      To every charm, and last and chief to you,      Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade      Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;            To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,      Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;       Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume      The sylvan cabin\'s lute-enlivened gloom.      - Alas! the very murmur of the streams      Breathes o\'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,      While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell      On joys that might disgrace the captive\'s cell,      Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como\'s marge,      And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.          Yet are thy softer arts with power indued      To soothe and cheer the poor man\'s solitude.      By silent cottage-doors, the peasant\'s home      Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.      But once I pierced the mazes of a wood      In which a cabin undeserted stood;       There an old man an olden measure scanned      On a rude viol touched with withered hand.      As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie      Under a hoary oak\'s thin canopy,                    Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,      His children\'s children listened to the sound;       - A Hermit with his family around!         But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles      Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:      Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa\'s stream,      Where, \'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.      From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire      The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire      To where afar rich orange lustres glow               Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:      Or, led where Via Mala\'s chasms confine      The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,      Hang o\'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom      His burning eyes with fearful light illume.        The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go      O\'er life\'s long deserts with its charge of woe,      With sad congratulation joins the train      Where beasts and men together o\'er the plain      Move on- a mighty caravan of pain:                 Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,      Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.      - There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:      Sole human tenant of the piny waste,      By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,      A nursling babe her only comforter;       Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,      A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!         When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows      Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,              And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad      Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road-       She seeks a covert from the battering shower      In the roofed bridge; a the bridge, ill that dread hour,      Itself all trembling at the torrent\'s power.        Nor is she more at ease on some \'still\' night,      When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;       Only the waning moon hangs dull and red      Above a melancholy mountain\'s head,      Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,              Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;       Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,      Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,      Listens, or quakes while from the forest\'s gulf      Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf.        From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide      Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide;       By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,      Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;       By cells upon whose image, while he prays,              The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;       By many a votive death-cross planted near,      And watered duly with the pious tear,      That faded silent from the upward eye      Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh;       Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves      Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves.        But soon a peopled region on the sight      Opens- a little world of calm delight;       Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,             Spread rooflike o\'er the deep secluded vale,      And beams of evening slipping in between,      Gently illuminate a sober scene:-       Here, on the brown wood-cottages they sleep,      There, over rock or sloping pasture creep.      On as we journey, in clear view displayed,      The still vale lengthens underneath its shade      Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead      The green light sparkles; - the dim bowers recede.      While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,         And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,      In solemn shapes before the admiring eye      Dilated hang the misty pines on high,      Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,      And antique castles seen through gleamy showers.        From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!       To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri\'s lake      In Nature\'s pristine majesty outspread,      Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread:      The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch               Far o\'er the water, hung with groves of beech;       Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,      Nor stop but where creation seems to end.      Yet here and there, if mid the savage scene      Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,      Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep      To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep,      - Before those thresholds (never can they know      The face of traveller passing to and fro,)       No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell                 For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;       Their watch-dog ne\'er his angry bark foregoes,      Touched by the beggar\'s moan of human woes;       The shady porch ne\'er offered a cool seat      To pilgrims overcome by summer\'s heat.      Yet thither the world\'s business finds its way      At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,      And \'there\' are those fond thoughts which Solitude,      However stern, is powerless to exclude.      There doth the maiden watch her lover\'s sail                Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;       At midnight listens till his parting oar,      And its last echo, can be heard no more.        And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons, cry      Amid tempestuous vapours driving by,      Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear      That common growth of earth, the foodful ear;       Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,      And pines the unripened pear in summer\'s kindliest ray;       Contentment shares the desolate domain                     With Independence, child of high Disdain.      Exulting \'mid the winter of the skies,      Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,      And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;       And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds      The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,      And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,      Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste      Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast.        Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour,           All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:      The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:      Dark is the region as with coming night;       But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!       Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,      Glances the wheeling eagle\'s glorious form!       Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine      The wood-crowned cliffs that o\'er the lake recline;       Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold,      At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:            Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun      The \'west\', that burns like one dilated sun,      A crucible of mighty compass, felt      By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt.        But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before      The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;       Confused the Marathonian tale appears,      While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears.      And who, that walks where men of ancient days      Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,              Feels not the spirit of the place control,      Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul?       Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,      Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,      On Zutphen\'s plain; or on that highland dell,      Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell      What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought      Of him whom passion rivets to the spot,      Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe\'s happiest sigh,      And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard\'s eye;                    Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,      And glad Dundee in \'faint huzzas\' expired?         But now with other mind I stand alone      Upon the summit of this naked cone,      And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase      His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space,        Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave      A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,      Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;       Thro\' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;          Where silent Hours their deathlike sway extend,      Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend      Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned      In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,      Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound.      - \'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,      To see a planet\'s pomp and steady light      In the least star of scarce-appearing night;       While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound      Of ether, shining with diminished round,                    And far and wide the icy summits blaze,      Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:      To him the day-star glitters small and bright,      Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,      And he can look beyond the sun, and view      Those fast-receding depths of sable blue      Flying till vision can no more pursue!       - At once bewildering mists around him close,      And cold and hunger are his least of woes;       The Demon of the snow, with angry roar                       Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.      Soon with despair\'s whole weight his spirits sink;       Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;       And, ere his eyes can close upon the day,      The eagle of the Alps o\'ershades her prey.        Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar,      Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;       Or rather stay to taste the mild delights      Of pensive Underwalden\'s pastoral heights.      - Is there who \'mid these awful wilds has seen                 The native Genii walk the mountain green?       Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,      Soft music o\'er the aerial summit steal?       While o\'er the desert, answering every close,      Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.      - And sure there is a secret Power that reigns      Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,      Nought but the \'chalets\', flat and bare, on high      Suspended \'mid the quiet of the sky;       Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,                And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep.      How still! no irreligious sound or sight      Rouses the soul from her severe delight.      An idle voice the sabbath region fills      Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,      And with that voice accords the soothing sound      Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;       Faint wail of eagle melting into blue      Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods\' steady \'sugh\';       The solitary heifer\'s deepened low;                        Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow.      All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,      Blend in a music of tranquillity;       Save when, a stranger seen below, the boy      Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.        When, from the sunny breast of open seas,      And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze      Comes on to gladden April with the sight      Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height;       When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,              And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,      The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,      Leaving to silence the deserted vale;       And like the Patriarchs in their simple age      Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage:      High and more high in summer\'s heat they go,      And hear the rattling thunder far below;       Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,      Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd.        One I behold who, \'cross the foaming flood,              Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;       Another, high on that green ledge; - he gained      The tempting spot with every sinew strained;       And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,      Food for his beasts in time of winter snows.      - Far different life from what Tradition hoar      Transmits of happier lot in times of yore!       Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed      From out the rocks, the wild bees\' safe abode:      Continual waters welling cheered the waste,               And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:      Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,      Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:      Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,      To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare.      Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,      And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,      Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand.      Thus does the father to his children tell      Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well.          Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod      Of angry Nature to avenge her God.      Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts      Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.        \'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows      More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.      Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,      A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,      A solemn sea! whose billows wide around      Stand motionless, to awful silence bound:              Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,      That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.      A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,      Gapes in the centre of the sea- and, through      That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound      Innumerable streams with roar profound.      Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,      And merry flageolet; the low of herds,      The bark of dogs, the heifer\'s tinkling bell,      Talk, laughter, and perchance a churchtower knell:       Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed      And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised:      Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less      Alive to independent happiness,      Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at eventide      Upon the fragrant mountain\'s purple side:      For as the pleasures of his simple day      Beyond his native valley seldom stray,      Nought round its darling precincts can he find      But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;           While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure\'s urn,      Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return.        Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,      Was blest as free- for he was Nature\'s child.      He, all superior but his God disdained,      Walked none restraining, and by none restrained      Confessed no law but what his reason taught,      Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought.      As man in his primeval dower arrayed      The image of his glorious Sire displayed,                 Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here      The traces of primeval Man appear;       The simple dignity no forms debase;       The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:      The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,      His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword;       Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared      With this \'the blessings he enjoys to guard.\'        And, as his native hills encircle ground      For many a marvellous victory renowned,                The work of Freedom daring to oppose,      With few in arms, innumerable foes,      When to those famous fields his steps are led,      An unknown power connects him with the dead:      For images of other worlds are there;       Awful the light, and holy is the air.      Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,      Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;       His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,      Beyond the senses and their little reign.                  And oft, when that dread vision hath past by,      He holds with God himself communion high,      There where the peal of swelling torrents fills      The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;       Or when, upon the mountain\'s silent brow      Reclined, he sees, above him and below,      Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;       While needle peaks of granite shooting bare      Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.      And when a gathering weight of shadows brown             Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;       And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms,      Uplift in quiet their illumined forms,      In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,      Tinged like an angel\'s smile all rosy red-       Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,      And the near heavens impart their own delights.        When downward to his winter hut he goes,      Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;       That hut which on the hills so oft employs               His thoughts, the central point of all his joys.      And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,      Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,      So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends      A little prattling child, he oft descends,      To glance a look upon the well-matched pair;       Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.      There, safely guarded by the woods behind,      He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,      Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,           And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound.        Through Nature\'s vale his homely pleasures glide,      Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;       The bound of all his vanity, to deck,      With one bright bell, a favourite heifer\'s neck;       Well pleased upon some simple annual feast,      Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,      If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,      Of thrice ten summers dignify the board.      - Alas! in every clime a flying ray                        Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;       And here the unwilling mind may more than trace      The general sorrows of the human race;       The churlish gales of penury, that blow      Cold as the north-wind o\'er a waste of snow,      To them the gentle groups of bliss deny      That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.      Yet more; - compelled by Powers which only deign      That \'solitary\' man disturb their reign,      Powers that support an unremitting strife               With all the tender charities of life,      Full oft the father, when his sons have grown      To manhood, seems their title to disown;       And from his nest amid the storms of heaven      Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;       With stern composure watches to the plain-       And never, eagle-like, beholds again!         When long-familiar joys are all resigned,      Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind?       Lo! where through flat Batavia\'s willowy groves,           Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;       O\'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,      And search the affections to their inmost cell;       Sweet poison spreads along the listener\'s veins,      Turning past pleasures into mortal pains;       Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,      Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave.        Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!       Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume!       Fresh gales and dews of life\'s delicious morn,            And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!       Alas! the little joy to man allowed      Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud;       Or like the beauty in a flower installed,      Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.      Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,      And taught that pain is pleasure\'s natural heir,      We still confide in more than we can know;       Death would be else the favourite friend of woe.        \'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,          Between interminable tracts of pine,      Within a temple stands an awful shrine,      By an uncertain light revealed, that falls      On the mute Image and the troubled walls.      Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain      That views, undimmed, Einsiedlen\'s wretched fane.      While ghastly faces through the gloom appear,      Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear;       While prayer contends with silenced agony,      Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.                 If the sad grave of human ignorance bear      One flower of hope- oh, pass and leave it there!         The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire,      Flings o\'er the wilderness a stream of fire:      Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day      Close on the remnant of their weary way;       While they are drawing toward the sacred floor      Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more.      How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste      The fountains reared for them amid the waste!           Their thirst they slake:- they wash their toil-worn feet      And some with tears of joy each other greet.      Yes, I must see you when ye first behold      Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,      In that glad moment will for you a sigh      Be heaved, of charitable sympathy;       In that glad moment when your hands are prest      In mute devotion on the thankful breast!         Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields      With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields:           Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,      And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend; -       A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns      Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;       Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:      \'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned,      They sport beneath that mountain\'s matchless height      That holds no commerce with the summer night.      From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds      The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;                     Appalling havoc! but serene his brow,      Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow;       Glitter the stars above, and all is black below.        What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,      While roars the sullen Arve in anger by,      That not for thy reward, unrivalled Vale!       Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;       That thou, the slaves of slaves, art doomed to pine      And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,      To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine.             Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,      With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way,      On the bleak sides of Cumbria\'s heath-clad moors,      Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland\'s shores;       To scent the sweets of Piedmont\'s breathing rose,      And orange gale that o\'er Lugano blows;       Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,      That virtue languishes and pleasure fails,      While the remotest hamlets blessings share      In thy loved presence known, and only there;                 \'Heart\'-blessings- outward treasures too which the eye      Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,      And every passing breeze will testify.      There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound      Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound;       The housewife there a brighter garden sees,      Where hum on busier wing her happy bees;       On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;       And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,-       To greet the traveller needing food and rest;            Housed for the night, or but a half-hour\'s guest.        And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees      Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;       Though martial songs have banished songs of love,      And nightingales desert the village grove,      Scared by the fife and rumbling drum\'s alarms,      And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;       That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,      Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!       - Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power         Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:      All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes      Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.      Yes, as I roamed where Loiret\'s waters glide      Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,      When from October clouds a milder light      Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;       Methought from every cot the watchful bird      Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;       Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,            Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;       Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf      Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief;       The measured echo of the distant flail      Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;       With more majestic course the water rolled,      And ripening foliage shone with richer gold.      - But foes are gathering- Liberty must raise      Red on the hills her beacon\'s far-seen blaze;       Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower! -              Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour!       Rejoice, brave Land, though pride\'s perverted ire      Rouse hell\'s own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:      Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;       As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth!       - All cannot be: the promise is too fair      For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:      Yet not for this will sober reason frown      Upon that promise, nor the hope disown;       She knows that only from high aims ensue                     Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due.        Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed      In an impartial balance, give thine aid      To the just cause; and, oh! do thou preside      Over the mighty stream now spreading wide:      So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied      In copious showers, from earth by wholesome springs,      Brood o\'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings!       And grant that every sceptred child of clay      Who cries presumptuous, \'Here the flood shall stay,\'                 May in its progress see thy guiding hand,      And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand;       Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore,      Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more!         To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot      Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot      In timely sleep; and when, at break of day,      On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play,      With a light heart our course we may renew,      The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.                    1791 & 1792.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Oak Of Guernica Supposed Address To The Same\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOAK of Guernica!

Shall this be so?That such a Boy where\'er he lists shall goIn your despite, and sing his hymns and saws,Which is against the reverence of our laws!\'XVII\'From that day forward have the Jews conspiredOut of the world this Innocent to chase;And to this end a Homicide they hired,That in an alley had a privy place,And, as the Child \'gan to the school to pace,This cruel Jew him seized, and held him fastAnd cut his throat, and in a pit him cast.XVIII\'I say that him into a pit they threw,A loathsome pit, whence noisome scents exhale;O cursed folk! away, ye Herods new!What may your ill intentions you avail?Murder will out; certes it will not fail;Know, that the honour of high God may spread,The blood cries out on your accursed deed.XIX\'O Martyr \'stablished in virginity!Now may\'st thou sing for aye before the throne,Following the Lamb celestial,\' quoth she,\'Of which the great Evangelist, Saint John,In Patmos wrote, who saith of them that goBefore the Lamb singing continually,That never fleshly woman they did know.XX\'Now this poor widow waiteth all that nightAfter her little Child, and he came not;For which, by earliest glimpse of morning light,With face all pale with dread and busy thought,She at the School and elsewhere him hath soughtUntil thus far she learned, that he had beenIn the Jews\' street, and there he last was seen.XXI\'With Mother\'s pity in her breast enclosedShe goeth, as she were half out of her mind,To every place wherein she hath supposedBy likelihood her little Son to find;And ever on Christ\'s Mother meek and kindShe cried, till to the Jewry she was brought,And him among the accursed Jews she sought.XXII\'She asketh, and she piteously doth prayTo every Jew that dwelleth in that placeTo tell her if her child had passed that way;They all said--Nay; but Jesu of his graceGave to her thought, that in a little spaceShe for her Son in that same spot did cryWhere he was cast into a pit hard by.XXIII\'O thou great God that dost perform thy laudBy mouths of Innocents, lo! here thy might;This gem of chastity, this emerald,And eke of martyrdom this ruby bright,There, where with mangled throat he lay upright,The \'Alma Redemptoris\' \'gan to sing,So loud, that with his voice the place did ring.XXIV\'The Christian folk that through the Jewry wentCome to the spot in wonder at the thing;And hastily they for the Provost sent;Immediately he came, not tarrying,And praiseth Christ that is our heavenly King,And eke his Mother, honour of Mankind:Which done he bade that they the Jews should bind.XXV\'This Child with piteous lamentation thenWas taken up, singing his song alway;And with procession great and pomp of menTo the next Abbey him they bare away;His Mother swooning by the body lay:And scarcely could the people that were nearRemove this second Rachel from the bier.XXVI\'Torment and shameful death to every oneThis Provost doth for those bad Jews prepareThat of this murder wist, and that anon:Such wickedness his judgments cannot spare;Who will do evil, evil shall he bear;Them therefore with wild horses did he draw,And after that he hung them by the law.XXVII\'Upon his bier this Innocent doth lieBefore the altar while the Mass doth last:The Abbot with his convent\'s companyThen sped themselves to bury him full fast;And, when they holy water on him cast,Yet spake this Child when sprinkled was the water,And sang, \'O Alma Redemptoris Mater!\'XXVIII\'This Abbot, for he was a holy man,As all Monks are, or surely ought to be,In supplication to the Child beganThus saying, \'O dear Child! I summon theeIn virtue of the holy TrinityTell me the cause why thou dost sing this hymnSince that thy throat is cut, as it doth seem.\'XXIX\'\'My throat is cut unto the bone, I trow,\'Said this young Child, \'and by the law of kindI should have died, yea many hours ago;But Jesus Christ, as in the books ye find,Will that his glory last, and be in mind;And, for the worship of his Mother dear,Yet may I sing \'O Alma!\' loud and clear.XXX\'\'This well of mercy, Jesu\'s Mother sweet,After my knowledge I have loved alway;And in the hour when I my death did meetTo me she came, and thus to me did say,\'Thou in thy dying sing this holy lay,\'As ye have heard; and soon as I had sungMethought she laid a grain upon my tongue.XXXI\'\'Wherefore I sing, nor can from song refrain,In honour of that blissful Maiden free,Till from my tongue off-taken is the grain;And after that thus said she unto me;\'My little Child, then will I come for theeSoon as the grain from off thy tongue they take:Be not dismayed, I will not thee forsake!\'XXXII\'This holy Monk, this Abbot--him mean I,Touched then his tongue, and took away the grain;And he gave up the ghost full peacefully;And, when the Abbot had this wonder seen,His salt tears trickled down like showers of rain;And on his face he dropped upon the ground,And still he lay as if he had been bound.XXXIII\'Eke the whole Convent on the pavement lay,Weeping and praising Jesu\'s Mother dear;And after that they rose, and took their way,And lifted up this Martyr from the bier,And in a tomb of precious marble clearEnclosed his uncorrupted body sweet.--Where\'er he be, God grant us him to meet!XXXIV\'Young Hew of Lincoln! in like sort laid lowBy cursed Jews--thing well and widely known,For it was done a little while ago--Pray also thou for us, while here we tarryWeak sinful folk, that God, with pitying eye,In mercy would his mercy multiplyOn us, for reverence of his Mother Mary!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo The Spade Of A Friend (An Agriculturist)\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCOMPOSED WHILE WE WERE LABOURING TOGETHER IN HIS PLEASURE-GROUNDSPADE! with which Wilkinson hath tilled his lands,And shaped these pleasant walks by Emont\'s side,Thou art a tool of honour in my hands;I press thee, through the yielding soil, with pride.Rare master has it been thy lot to know;Long hast Thou served a man to reason true;Whose life combines the best of high and low,The labouring many and the resting few;Health, meekness, ardour, quietness secure,And industry of body and of mind; And elegant enjoyments, that are pureAs nature is; too pure to be refined.Here often hast Thou heard the Poet singIn concord with his river murmuring by;Or in some silent field, while timid springIs yet uncheered by other minstrelsy.Who shall inherit Thee when death has laidLow in the darksome cell thine own dear lord?That man will have a trophy, humble Spade!A trophy nobler than a conqueror\'s sword.

Him will I take, and in close covert keep,\'Mid groves Idalian, lulled to gentle sleep,Or on Cythera\'s far-sequestered steep,That he may neither know what hope is mine,Nor by his presence traverse the design.Do thou, but for a single night\'s brief space,Dissemble; be that boy in form and face!And when enraptured Dido shall receiveThee to her arms, and kisses interweaveWith many a fond embrace, while joy runs high, And goblets crown the proud festivity,Instil thy subtle poison, and inspire,At every touch, an unsuspected fire.\'Love, at the word, before his mother\'s sightPuts off his wings, and walks, with proud delight,Like young Iulus; but the gentlest dewsOf slumber Venus sheds, to circumfuseThe true Ascanius steeped in placid rest;Then wafts him, cherished on her careful breast,Through upper air to an Idalian glade, Where he on soft \'amaracus\' is laid,With breathing flowers embraced, and fragrant shade.But Cupid, following cheerily his guideAchates, with the gifts to Carthage hied;And, as the hall he entered, there, betweenThe sharers of her golden couch, was seenReclined in festal pomp the Tyrian queen.The Trojans, too (Aeneas at their head),On conches lie, with purple overspread:Meantime in canisters is heaped the bread, Pellucid water for the hands is borne,And napkins of smooth texture, finely shorn.Within are fifty handmaids, who prepare,As they in order stand, the dainty fare;And fume the household deities with storeOf odorous incense; while a hundred moreMatched with an equal number of like age,But each of manly sex, a docile page,Marshal the banquet, giving with due graceTo cup or viand its appointed place. The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.They look with wonder on the gifts--they gazeUpon Iulus, dazzled with the raysThat from his ardent countenance are flung,And charmed to hear his simulating tongue;Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine,Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.But chiefly Dido, to the coming illDevoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill; She views the gifts; upon the child then turnsInsatiable looks, and gazing burns.To ease a father\'s cheated love he hungUpon Aeneas, and around him clung;Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries;She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes,Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)How great a God, incumbent o\'er her breast,Would fill it with his spirit. He, to pleaseHis Acidalian mother, by degrees Blots out Sichaeus, studious to removeThe dead, by influx of a living love,By stealthy entrance of a perilous guest.Troubling a heart that had been long at rest.Now when the viands were withdrawn, and ceasedThe first division of the splendid feast,While round a vacant board the chiefs recline,Huge goblets are brought forth; they crown the wine;Voices of gladness roll the walls around;Those gladsome voices from the courts rebound; From gilded rafters many a blazing lightDepends, and torches overcome the night.The minutes fly--till, at the queen\'s command,A bowl of state is offered to her hand:Then she, as Belus wont, and all the lineFrom Belus, filled it to the brim with wine;Silence ensued. \'O Jupiter, whose careIs hospitable dealing, grant my prayer!Productive day be this of lasting joyTo Tyrians, and these exiles driven from Troy; A day to future generations dear!Let Bacchus, donor of soul-quick\'ning cheer,Be present; kindly Juno, be thou near!And, Tyrians, may your choicest favours waitUpon this hour, the bond to celebrate!\'She spake and shed an offering on the board;Then sipped the bowl whence she the wine had pouredAnd gave to Bitias, urging the prompt lord;He raised the bowl, and took a long deep draught;Then every chief in turn the beverage quaffed. Graced with redundant hair, Iopas singsThe lore of Atlas, to resounding strings,The labours of the Sun, the lunar wanderings;When human kind, and brute; what natural powersEngender lightning, whence are falling showers.He haunts Arcturus,--that fraternal twainThe glittering Bears,--the Pleiads fraught with rain;--Why suns in winter, shunning heaven\'s steep heightsPost seaward,--what impedes the tardy nights.The learned song from Tyrian hearers draws Loud shouts,--the Trojans echo the applause.--But, lengthening out the night with converse new,Large draughts of love unhappy Dido drew;Of Priam asked, of Hector--o\'er and o\'er--What arms the son of bright Aurora wore;--What steeds the car of Diomed could boast;Among the leaders of the Grecian host.How looked Achilles, their dread paramount--\'But nay--the fatal wiles, O guest, recount,Retrace the Grecian cunning from its source, Your own grief and your friends?--your wandering course;For now, till this seventh summer have ye rangedThe sea, or trod the earth, to peace estranged.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Thomas Clarkson\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nON THE FINAL PASSING OF THE BILL FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADEMARCH 1807CLARKSON! it was an obstinate hill to climb:How toilsome--nay, how dire--it was, by theeIs known; by none, perhaps, so feelingly:But thou, who, starting in thy fervent prime,Didst first lead forth that enterprise sublime,Hast heard the constant Voice its charge repeat,Which, out of thy young heart\'s oracular seat,First roused thee.--O true yoke-fellow of Time,Duty\'s intrepid liegeman, see, the palmIs won, and by all Nations shall be worn!

News from Mona\'s Isle?Such have we, but unvaried in its style; No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whenceAnd wherefore fugitive or on what pretence;Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the windMost restlessly alive when most confined.Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appeaseThe mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS;The last year\'s cup whose Ram or Heifer gained,What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained:An eye of fancy only can I castOn that proud pageant now at hand or past, When full five hundred boats in trim array,With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay,And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer,For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair,Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shineLike beds of moonlight shifting on the brine.Mona from our Abode is daily seen,But with a wilderness of waves between;And by conjecture only can we speakOf aught transacted there in bay or creek; No tidings reach us thence from town or field,Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield,And some we gather from the misty air,And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare.But these poetic mysteries I withhold;For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold,And should the colder fit with You be onWhen You might read, my credit would be gone.Let more substantial themes the pen engage,And nearer interests culled from the opening stage Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawnHad from the east her silver star withdrawn,The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door,Thoughtfully freighted with a various store;And long or ere the uprising of the SunO\'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun,A needful journey, under favouring skies,Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guiseOf those old Patriarchs when from well to wellThey roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabsdwell. Say first, to whom did we the charge confide,Who promptly undertook the Wain to guideUp many a sharply-twining road and down,And over many a wide hill\'s craggy crown,Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook,And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook?A blooming Lass--who in her better handBore a light switch, her sceptre of commandWhen, yet a slender Girl, she often led,Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar\'s head.What could go wrong with such a CharioteerFor goods and chattels, or those Infants dear,A Pair who smilingly sate side by side,Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tideWhose free embraces we were bound to seek,Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek?Such hope did either Parent entertainPacing behind along the silent lane.Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight, For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight--On a green bank a creature stood forlornJust half protruded to the light of morn,Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thornThe Figure called to mind a beast of preyStript of its frightful powers by slow decay,And, though no longer upon rapine bent,Dim memory keeping of its old intent.We started, looked again with anxious eyes,And in that griesly object recognise The Curate\'s Dog--his long-tried friend, for they,As well we knew, together had grown grey.The Master died, his drooping servant\'s griefFound at the Widow\'s feet some sad relief;Yet still he lived in pining discontent,Sadness which no indulgence could prevent;Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleepsAnd lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps;Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute!Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute, And of all visible motion destitute,So that the very heaving of his breathSeemed stopt, though by some other power than death.Long as we gazed upon the form and face,A mild domestic pity kept its place,Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hueThat haunted us in spite of what we knew.Even now I sometimes think of him as lostIn second-sight appearances, or crostBy spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground, On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound,Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to waitIn days of old romance at Archimago\'s gate.Advancing Summer, Nature\'s law fulfilled,The choristers in every grove had stilled;But we, we lacked not music of our own,For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown,Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues,Some notes prelusive, from the round of songsWith which, more zealous than the liveliest bird That in wild Arden\'s brakes was ever heard,Her work and her work\'s partners she can cheer,The whole day long, and all days of the year.Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we passAnd soon approach Diana\'s Looking-glass!To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven,Such name Italian fancy would have given,Ere on its banks the few grey cabins roseThat yet disturb not its concealed reposeMore than the feeblest wind that idly blows. Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the roadStopped me at once by charm of what it showed,The encircling region vividly exprestWithin the mirror\'s depth, a world at rest--Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield,And the smooth green of many a pendent field,And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small,A little daring would-be waterfall,One chimney smoking and its azure wreath,Associate all in the calm Pool beneath, With here and there a faint imperfect gleamOf water-lilies veiled in misty steam--What wonder at this hour of stillness deep,A shadowy link \'tween wakefulness and sleep,When Nature\'s self, amid such blending, seemsTo render visible her own soft dreams,If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood,Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood,A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by TheeDesigned to rise in humble privacy, A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread,Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful headHalf hid in native trees. Alas \'tis not,Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spotUnconscious of its own untoward lot,And thought in silence, with regret too keen,Of unexperienced joys that might have been;Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts,And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts.But time, irrevocable time, is flown. And let us utter thanks for blessings sownAnd reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own.Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee,Startling us all, dispersed my reverie;Such shout as many a sportive echo meetingOft-times from Alpine \'chalets\' sends a greeting.Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant standOn high, a kerchief waving in her hand!Not unexpectant that by early dayOur little Band would thrid this mountain way, Before her cottage on the bright hill sideShe hath advanced with hope to be descried.Right gladly answering signals we displayed,Moving along a tract of morning shade,And vocal wishes sent of like good willTo our kind Friend high on the sunny hill--Luminous region, fair as if the primeWere tempting all astir to look aloft or climb;Only the centre of the shining cotWith door left open makes a gloomy spot, Emblem of those dark corners sometimes foundWithin the happiest breast on earthly ground.Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale,And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale;Descend, and reach, in Yewdale\'s depths, a plainWith haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain--An area level as a Lake and spreadUnder a rock too steep for man to tread,Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwestAloft the Raven hangs a visible nest, Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest.Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark,At our approach, a jealous watch-dog\'s bark,Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state,But the whole household, that our coming wait.With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange,And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly GrangePress forward by the teasing dogs unscared.Entering, we find the morning meal prepared:So down we sit, though not till each had cast Pleased looks around the delicate repast--Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest,With amber honey from the mountain\'s breast;Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wildOf children\'s industry, in hillocks piled;Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lieUpon a lordly dish; frank hospitalityWhere simple art with bounteous nature vied,And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride.Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast, If thou be lovelier than the kindling East,Words by thy presence unrestrained may speakOf a perpetual dawn from brow and cheekInstinct with light whose sweetest promise lies,Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes,Dark but to every gentle feeling true,As if their lustre flowed from ether\'s purest blue.Let me not ask what tears may have been weptBy those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept,Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relievedBy fortitude and patience, and the graceOf heaven in pity visiting the place.Not unadvisedly those secret springsI leave unsearched: enough that memory clings,Here as elsewhere, to notices that makeTheir own significance for hearts awake,To rural incidents, whose genial powersFilled with delight three summer morning hours.More cold my pen report of grave or gay That through our gipsy travel cheered the way;But, bursting forth above the waves, the SunLaughs at my pains, and seems to say, \'Be done.\'Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reproveThis humble offering made by Truth to Love,Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spellWhich might have else been on me yet:--FAREWELL.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Martial Courage Of A Day Is Vain\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE martial courage of a day is vain,An empty noise of death the battle\'s roar,If vital hope be wanting to restore,Or fortitude be wanting to sustain,Armies or kingdoms.

January 18, 1816\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIHAIL, orient Conqueror of gloomy Night!Thou that canst shed the bliss of gratitudeOn hearts howe\'er insensible or rude;Whether thy punctual visitations smiteThe haughty towers where monarchs dwell;Or thou, impartial Sun, with presence brightCheer\'st the low threshold of the peasant\'s cell!Not unrejoiced I see thee climb the skyIn naked splendour, clear from mist or haze,Or cloud approaching to divert the rays,Which even in deepest winter testifyThy power and majesty,Dazzling the vision that presumes to gaze.--Well does thine aspect usher in this Day;As aptly suits therewith that modest paceSubmitted to the chainsThat bind thee to the path which God ordainsThat thou shalt trace,Till, with the heavens and earth, thou pass away!Nor less, the stillness of these frosty plains,Their utter stillness, and the silent graceOf yon ethereal summits white with snow,(Whose tranquil pomp and spotless purityReport of storms gone byTo us who tread below)Do with the service of this Day accord.--Divinest Object which the uplifted eyeOf mortal man is suffered to behold;Thou, who upon those snow-clad Heights has pouredMeek lustre, nor forget\'st the humble Vale;Thou who dost warm Earth\'s universal mould,And for thy bounty wert not unadoredBy pious men of old;Once more, heart-cheering Sun, I bid thee hail!Bright be thy course to-day, let not this promise fail!II\'Mid the deep quiet of this morning hour,All nature seems to hear me while I speak,By feelings urged that do not vainly seekApt language, ready as the tuneful notesThat stream in blithe succession from the throatsOf birds, in leafy bower,Warbling a farewell to a vernal shower.--There is a radiant though a short-lived flame,That burns for Poets in the dawning east;And oft my soul hath kindled at the same,When the captivity of sleep had ceased;But He who fixed immoveably the frameOf the round world, and built, by laws as strong,A solid refuge for distress--The towers of righteousness;He knows that from a holier altar cameThe quickening spark of this day\'s sacrifice;Knows that the source is nobler whence doth riseThe current of this matin song;That deeper far it liesThan aught dependent on the fickle skies.IIIHave we not conquered?--by the vengeful sword?Ah no, by dint of Magnanimity;That curbed the baser passions, and left freeA loyal band to follow their liege LordClear-sighted Honour, and his staid Compeers,Along a track of most unnatural years;In execution of heroic deedsWhose memory, spotless as the crystal beadsOf morning dew upon the untrodden meads,Shall live enrolled above the starry spheres.He, who in concert with an earthly stringOf Britain\'s acts would sing,He with enraptured voice will tellOf One whose spirit no reverse could quell;Of One that \'mid the failing never failed--Who paints how Britain struggled and prevailedShall represent her labouring with an eyeOf circumspect humanity;Shall show her clothed with strength and skill,All martial duties to fulfil;Firm as a rock in stationary fight;In motion rapid as the lightning\'s gleam;Fierce as a flood-gate bursting at midnightTo rouse the wicked from their giddy dream--Woe, woe to all that face her in the field!Appalled she may not be, and cannot yield.IVAnd thus is \'missed\' the sole true gloryThat can belong to human story!At which they only shall arriveWho through the abyss of weakness dive.The very humblest are too proud of heart;And one brief day is rightly set apartFor Him who lifteth up and layeth low;For that Almighty God to whom we owe,Say not that we have vanquished--but that we survive.VHow dreadful the dominion of the impure!Why should the Song be tardy to proclaimThat less than power unbounded could not tameThat soul of Evil--which, from hell let loose,Had filled the astonished world with such abuseAs boundless patience only could endure?--Wide-wasted regions--cities wrapt in flame--Who sees, may lift a streaming eyeTo Heaven;--who never saw, may heave a sigh;But the foundation of our nature shakes,And with an infinite pain the spirit aches,When desolated countries, towns on fire,Are but the avowed attireOf warfare waged with desperate mindAgainst the life of virtue in mankind;Assaulting without ruthThe citadels of truth;While the fair gardens of civility,By ignorance defaced,By violence laid waste,Perish without reprieve for flower or tree!VIA crouching purpose--a distracted will--Opposed to hopes that battened upon scorn,And to desires whose ever-waxing hornNot all the light of earthly power could fill;Opposed to dark, deep plots of patient skill,And to celerities of lawless force;Which, spurning God, had flung away remorse--What could they gain but shadows of redress?--So bad proceeded propagating worse;And discipline was passion\'s dire excess.Widens the fatal web, its lines extend,And deadlier poisons in the chalice blend.When will your trials teach you to be wise?--O prostrate Lands, consult your agonies!VIINo more--the guilt is banished,And, with the guilt, the shame is fled;And, with the guilt and shame, the Woe hath vanished,Shaking the dust and ashes from her head!--No more--these lingerings of distressSully the limpid stream of thankfulness.What robe can Gratitude employSo seemly as the radiant vest of Joy?What steps so suitable as those that moveIn prompt obedience to spontaneous measuresOf glory, and felicity, and love,Surrendering the whole heart to sacred pleasures?VIIIO Britain! dearer far than life is dear,If one there beOf all thy progenyWho can forget thy prowess, never moreBe that ungrateful Son allowed to hearThy green leaves rustle or thy torrents roar.As springs the lion from his den,As from a forest-brakeUpstarts a glistering snake,The bold Arch-despot re-appeared;--againWide Europe heaves, impatient to be cast,With all her armed Powers,On that offensive soil, like waves upon a thousand shores.The trumpet blew a universal blast!But Thou art foremost in the field:--there stand:Receive the triumph destined to thy hand!All States have glorified themselves;--their claimsAre weighed by Providence, in balance even;And now, in preference to the mightiest names,To Thee the exterminating sword is given.Dread mark of approbation, justly gained!Exalted office, worthily sustained!IXPreserve, O Lord! within our heartsThe memory of thy favour,That else insensibly departs,And loses its sweet savour!Lodge it within us!--as the power of lightLives inexhaustibly in precious gems,Fixed on the front of Eastern diadems,So shine our thankfulness for ever bright!What offering, what transcendent monumentShall our sincerity to Thee present?--Not work of hands; but trophies that may reachTo highest Heaven--the labour of the Soul;That builds, as thy unerring precepts teach,Upon the internal conquests made by each,Her hope of lasting glory for the whole.Yet will not heaven disown nor earth gainsayThe outward service of this day;Whether the worshippers entreatForgiveness from God\'s mercy-seat;Or thanks and praises to His throne ascendThat He has brought our warfare to an end,And that we need no second victory!--Ha! what a ghastly sight for man to see;And to the heavenly saints in peace who dwell,For a brief moment, terrible;But, to thy sovereign penetration, fair,Before whom all things are, that were,All judgments that have been, or e\'er shall be;Links in the chain of thy tranquillity!Along the bosom of this favoured Nation,Breathe Thou, this day, a vital undulation!Let all who do this land inheritBe conscious of thy moving spirit!Oh, \'tis a goodly Ordinance,--the sight,Though sprung from bleeding war, is one of pure delight;Bless Thou the hour, or ere the hour arrive,When a whole people shall kneel down in prayer,And, at one moment, in one rapture, striveWith lip and heart to tell their gratitudeFor thy protecting care,Their solemn joy--praising the Eternal LordFor tyranny subdued,And for the sway of equity renewed,For liberty confirmed, and peace restored!XBut hark--the summons!--down the placid lakeFloats the soft cadence of the church-tower bells;Bright shines the Sun, as if his beams would wakeThe tender insects sleeping in their cells;Bright shines the Sun--and not a breeze to shakeThe drops that tip the melting icicles.\'O, enter now his temple gate!\'Inviting words--perchance already flung(As the crowd press devoutly down the aisleOf some old Minster\'s venerable pile)From voices into zealous passion stung,While the tubed engine feels the

banner of our joy we will erect,And strength of love our souls shall elevate:For to a few collected in his name,Their heavenly Father will incline an earGracious to service hallowed by its

voice; it said, \'Drink, pretty creature, drink!\'And, looking o\'er the hedge, before me I espiedA snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook. \'Drink, pretty creature, drink,\' she said in such a toneThat I almost received her heart into my own.\'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair.Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away:But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady placeI unobserved could see the workings of her face:If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing: \'What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord?Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;Rest, little young One, rest; what is\'t that aileth thee?\'What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!\'If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain; For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need\'st not fear,The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.\'Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the dayWhen my father found thee first in places far away;Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.\'He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yeanUpon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been. \'Thou know\'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this canFresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.\'Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,Then I\'ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is coldOur hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.\'It will not, will not rest!--Poor creature, can it beThat \'tis thy mother\'s heart which is working so in thee?

his boat and twinkling oar.My father was a good and pious man,An honest man, by honest parents bred,And I believe that, soon as I beganTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,And in his hearing there my prayers I said:And afterwards, by my good father taught,I read, and loved the books in which I read;For books in every neighboring house I sought,And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.Can I forget what charms did once adornMy garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme,And rose and lily for the sabbath morn?The sabbath bells, and the delightful chime;The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time;My hen\'s rich nest through long grass scarce espied;The cowslip-gathering at May\'s dewy prime;The swans, that when I sought the water-side,From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride.The staff I yet remember which upboreThe bending body of my active sire;His seat beneath the honeyed sycamoreWhen the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;When market-morning came, the neat attireWith which, though bent on haste, myself I deck\'d;My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire,When stranger passed, so often I have check\'d;The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck\'d.The suns of twenty summers danced along, -Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away:Then rose a mansion proud our woods among,And cottage after cottage owned its sway,No joy to see a neighboring house, or strayThrough pastures not his own, the master took;My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay;He loved his old hereditary nook,And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook.But, when he had refused the proffered gold,To cruel injuries he became a prey,Sore traversed in whate\'er he bought and sold:His troubles grew upon him day by day,Till all his substance fell into decay.His little range of water was denied;All but the bed where his old body lay,All, all was seized, and weeping, side by side,We sought a home where we uninjured might abide.Can I forget that miserable hour,When from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,Peering above the trees, the steeple tower,That on his marriage-day sweet music made?Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid,Close by my mother in their native bowers:Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed, \\\'f3 I could not pray: \\\'f3 through tears that fell in showers,Glimmer\'d our dear-loved home, alas!

Then peace to cruelty and scorn,While to the prison they are borne,Peace, peace to all indignity!\'And so in Prison were they laid--Oh hear me, hear me, gentle Maid,For I am come with power to bless,By scattering gleams, through your distress,Of a redeeming happiness.Me did a reverent pity moveAnd privilege of ancient love; And, in your service, making bold,Entrance I gained to that stronghold.Your Father gave me cordial greeting;But to his purposes, that burnedWithin him, instantly returned:He was commanding and entreating,And said--\'We need not stop, my Son!Thoughts press, and time is hurrying on\'--And so to Francis he renewedHis words, more calmly thus pursued. \'Might this our enterprise have sped,Change wide and deep the Land had seen,A renovation from the dead,A spring-tide of immortal green:The darksome altars would have blazedLike stars when clouds are rolled away;Salvation to all eyes that gazed,Once more the Rood had been upraisedTo spread its arms, and stand for aye.Then, then--had I survived to see New life in Bolton Priory;The voice restored, the eye of TruthRe-opened that inspired my youth;To see her in her pomp arrayed--This Banner (for such vow I made)Should on the consecrated breastOf that same Temple have found rest:I would myself have hung it high,Fit offering of glad victory!A shadow of such thought remains To cheer this sad and pensive time;A solemn fancy yet sustainsOne feeble Being--bids me climbEven to the last--one effort moreTo attest my Faith, if not restore.Hear then,\' said he, \'while I impart,My Son, the last wish of my heart.The Banner strive thou to regain;And, if the endeavour prove not vain,Bear it--to whom if not to thee Shall I this lonely thought consign?--Bear it to Bolton Priory,And lay it on Saint Mary\'s shrine;To wither in the sun and breeze\'Mid those decaying sanctities.There let at least the gift be laid,The testimony there displayed;Bold proof that with no selfish aim,But for lost Faith and Christ\'s dear name,I helmeted a brow though white, And took a place in all men\'s sight;Yea offered up this noble Brood,This fair unrivalled Brotherhood,And turned away from thee, my Son!And left--but be the rest unsaid,The name untouched, the tear unshed;--My wish is known, and I have done:Now promise, grant this one request,This dying prayer, and be thou blest!\'Then Francis answered--\'Trust thy Son, For, with God\'s will, it shall be done!\'--The pledge obtained, the solemn wordThus scarcely given, a noise was heard,And Officers appeared in stateTo lead the prisoners to their fate.They rose, oh! wherefore should I fearTo tell, or, Lady, you to hear?They rose--embraces none were given--They stood like trees when earth and heavenAre calm; they knew each other\'s worth, And reverently the Band went forth.They met, when they had reached the door,One with profane and harsh intentPlaced there--that he might go beforeAnd, with that rueful Banner borneAloft in sign of taunting scorn,Conduct them to their punishment:So cruel Sussex, unrestrainedBy human feeling, had ordained.The unhappy Banner Francis saw, And, with a look of calm commandInspiring universal awe,He took it from the soldier\'s hand;And all the people that stood roundConfirmed the deed in peace profound.--High transport did the Father shedUpon his Son--and they were led,Led on, and yielded up their breath;Together died, a happy death!--But Francis, soon as he had braved That insult, and the Banner saved,Athwart the unresisting tideOf the spectators occupiedIn admiration or dismay,Bore instantly his Charge away.\'These things, which thus had in the sightAnd hearing passed of Him who stoodWith Emily, on the Watch-tower height,In Rylstone\'s woeful neighbourhood,He told; and oftentimes with voice Of power to comfort or rejoice;For deepest sorrows that aspire,Go high, no transport ever higher.\'Yes--God is rich in mercy,\' saidThe old Man to the silent Maid,\'Yet, Lady! shines, through this black night,One star of aspect heavenly bright;Your Brother lives--he lives--is comePerhaps already to his home;Then let us leave this dreary place.\' She yielded, and with gentle pace,Though without one uplifted look,To Rylstone-hall her way she took.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM Bolton\'s old monastic towerThe bells ring loud with gladsome power;The sun shines bright; the fields are gayWith people in their best arrayOf stole and doublet, hood and scarf,Along the banks of crystal Wharf,Through the Vale retired and lowly,Trooping to that summons holy.And, up among the moorlands, seeWhat sprinklings of blithe company! Of lasses and of shepherd grooms,That down the steep hills force their way,Like cattle through the budded brooms;Path, or no path, what care they?And thus in joyous mood they hieTo Bolton\'s mouldering Priory.What would they there?--Full fifty yearsThat sumptuous Pile, with all its peers,Too harshly hath been doomed to tasteThe bitterness of wrong and waste: Its courts are ravaged; but the towerIs standing with a voice of power,That ancient voice which wont to callTo mass or some high festival;And in the shattered fabric\'s heartRemaineth one protected part;A Chapel, like a wild-bird\'s nest,Closely embowered and trimly drest;And thither young and old repair,This Sabbath-day, for praise and prayer. Fast the churchyard fills;--anonLook again, and they all are gone;The cluster round the porch, and the folkWho sate in the shade of the Prior\'s Oak!And scarcely have they disappearedEre the prelusive hymn is heard:--With one consent the people rejoice,Filling the church with a lofty voice!They sing a service which they feel:For \'tis the sunrise now of zeal; Of a pure faith the vernal prime--In great Eliza\'s golden time.A moment ends the fervent din,And all is hushed, without and within;For though the priest, more tranquilly,Recites the holy liturgy,The only voice which you can hearIs the river murmuring near.--When soft!--the dusky trees between,And down the path through the open green, Where is no living thing to be seen;And through yon gateway, where is found,Beneath the arch with ivy bound,Free entrance to the churchyard ground--Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,Comes gliding in serene and slow,Soft and silent as a dream,A solitary Doe!White she is as lily of June,And beauteous as the silver moon When out of sight the clouds are drivenAnd she is left alone in heaven;Or like a ship some gentle dayIn sunshine sailing far away,A glittering ship, that hath the plainOf ocean for her own domain.Lie silent in your graves, ye dead!Lie quiet in your churchyard bed!Ye living, tend your holy cares;Ye multitude, pursue your prayers; And blame not me if my heart and sightAre occupied with one delight!\'Tis a work for sabbath hoursIf I with this bright Creature go:Whether she be of forest bowers,From the bowers of earth below;Or a Spirit for one day given,A pledge of grace from purest heaven.What harmonious pensive changesWait upon her as she ranges Round and through this Pile of stateOverthrown and desolate!Now a step or two her wayLeads through space of open day,Where the enamoured sunny lightBrightens her that was so bright;Now doth a delicate shadow fall,Falls upon her like a breath,From some lofty arch or wall,As she passes underneath: Now some gloomy nook partakesOf the glory that she makes,--High-ribbed vault of stone, or cell,With perfect cunning framed as wellOf stone, and ivy, and the spreadOf the elder\'s bushy head;Some jealous and forbidding cell,That doth the living stars repel,And where no flower hath leave to dwell.The presence of this wandering Doe Fills many a damp obscure recessWith lustre of a saintly show;And, reappearing, she no lessSheds on the flowers that round her blowA more than sunny liveliness.But say, among these holy places,Which thus assiduously she paces,Comes she with a votary\'s task,Rite to perform, or boon to ask?Fair Pilgrim! harbours she a sense Of sorrow, or of reverence?Can she be grieved for quire or shrine,Crushed as if by wrath divine?For what survives of house where GodWas worshipped, or where Man abode;For old magnificence undone;Or for the gentler work begunBy Nature, softening and concealing,And busy with a hand of healing?Mourns she for lordly chamber\'s hearth That to the sapling ash gives birth;For dormitory\'s length laid bareWhere the wild rose blossoms fair;Or altar, whence the cross was rent,Now rich with mossy ornament?--She sees a warrior carved in stone,Among the thick weeds, stretched alone;A warrior, with his shield of prideCleaving humbly to his side,And hands in resignation prest, Palm to palm, on his tranquil breast;As little she regards the sightAs a common creature might:If she be doomed to inward care,Or service, it must lie elsewhere.--But hers are eyes serenely bright,And on she moves--with pace how light!Nor spares to stoop her head, and tasteThe dewy turf with flowers bestrown;And thus she fares, until at last Beside the ridge of a grassy graveIn quietness she lays her down;Gentle as a weary waveSinks, when the summer breeze hath died,Against an anchored vessel\'s side;Even so, without distress, doth sheLie down in peace, and lovingly.The day is placid in its going,To a lingering motion bound,Like the crystal stream now flowing With its softest summer sound:So the balmy minutes pass,While this radiant Creature liesCouched upon the dewy grass,Pensively with downcast eyes.--But now again the people raiseWith awful cheer a voice of praise;It is the last, the parting song;And from the temple forth they throng,And quickly spread themselves abroad, While each pursues his several road.But some--a variegated bandOf middle-aged, and old, and young,And little children by the handUpon their leading mothers hung--With mute obeisance gladly paidTurn towards the spot, where, full in view,The white Doe, to her service true,Her sabbath couch has made.It was a solitary mound; Which two spears\' length of level groundDid from all other graves divide:As if in some respect of pride;Or melancholy\'s sickly mood,Still shy of human neighbourhood;Or guilt, that humbly would expressA penitential loneliness.\'Look, there she is, my Child! draw near;She fears not, wherefore should we fear?She means no harm;\'--but still the Boy, To whom the words were softly said,Hung back, and smiled, and blushed for joy,A shame-faced blush of glowing red!Again the Mother whispered low,\'Now you have seen the famous Doe;From Rylstone she hath found her wayOver the hills this sabbath dayHer work, whate\'er it be, is done,And she will depart when we are gone;Thus doth she keep, from year to year, Her sabbath morning, foul or fair.\'Bright was the Creature, as in dreamsThe Boy had seen her, yea, more bright;But is she truly what she seems?He asks with insecure delight,Asks of himself, and doubts,--and stillThe doubt returns against his will:Though he, and all the standers-by,Could tell a tragic historyOf facts divulged, wherein appear Substantial motive, reason clear,Why thus the milk-white Doe is foundCouchant beside that lonely mound;And why she duly loves to paceThe circuit of this hallowed place.Nor to the Child\'s inquiring mindIs such perplexity confined:For, spite of sober Truth that seesA world of fixed remembrancesWhich to this mystery belong, If, undeceived, my skill can traceThe characters of every face,There lack not strange delusion here,Conjecture vague, and idle fear,And superstitious fancies strong,Which do the gentle Creature wrong.That bearded, staff-supported Sire--Who in his boyhood often fedFull cheerily on convent-breadAnd heard old tales by the convent-fire, And to his grave will go with scars,Relics of long and distant wars--That Old Man, studious to expoundThe spectacle, is mounting highTo days of dim antiquity;When Lady Aaliza mournedHer Son, and felt in her despairThe pang of unavailing prayer;Her Son in Wharf\'s abysses drowned,The noble Boy of Egremound. From which affliction--when the graceOf God had in her heart found place--A pious structure, fair to seeRose up, this stately Priory!The Lady\'s work;--but now laid low;To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustainA softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright; And glides o\'er the earth like an angel of light.Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;And, through the chink in the fractured floorLook down, and see a griesly sight;A vault where the bodies are buried upright!There, face by face, and hand by hand,The Claphams and Mauleverers stand;And, in his place, among son and sire,Is John de Clapham, that fierce Esquire,A valiant man, and a name of dread In the ruthless wars of the White and Red;Who dragged Earl Pembroke from Banbury churchAnd smote off his head on the stones of the porch!Look down among them, if you dare;Oft does the White Doe loiter there,Prying into the darksome rent;Nor can it be with good intent:So thinks that Dame of haughty air,Who hath a Page her book to hold,And wears a frontlet edged with gold. Harsh thoughts with her high mood agree--Who counts among her ancestryEarl Pembroke, slain so impiously!That slender Youth, a scholar pale,From Oxford come to his native vale,He also hath his own conceit:It is, thinks he, the gracious Fairy,Who loved the Shepherd-lord to meetIn his wanderings solitary:Wild notes she in his hearing sang, A song of Nature\'s hidden powers;That whistled like the wind, and rangAmong the rocks and holly bowers.\'Twas said that She all shapes could wear;And oftentimes before him stood,Amid the trees of some thick wood,In semblance of a lady fair;And taught him signs, and showed him sights,In Craven\'s dens, on Cumbrian heights;When under cloud of fear he lay, A shepherd clad in homely grey;Nor left him at his later day.And hence, when he, with spear and shield,Rode full of years to Flodden-field,His eye could see the hidden spring,And how the current was to flow;The fatal end of Scotland\'s King,And all that hopeless overthrow.But not in wars did he delight,\'This\' Clifford wished for worthier might; Nor in broad pomp, or courtly state;Him his own thoughts did elevate,--Most happy in the shy recessOf Barden\'s lowly quietness.And choice of studious friends had heOf Bolton\'s dear fraternity;Who, standing on this old church tower,In many a calm propitious hour,Perused, with him, the starry sky;Or, in their cells, with him did pry For other lore,--by keen desireUrged to close toil with chemic fire;In quest belike of transmutationsRich as the mine\'s most bright creations.But they and their good works are fled,And all is now disquieted--And peace is none, for living or dead!Ah, pensive Scholar, think not so,But look again at the radiant Doe!What quiet watch she seems to keep, Alone, beside that grassy heap!Why mention other thoughts unmeetFor vision so composed and sweet?While stand the people in a ring,Gazing, doubting, questioning;Yea, many overcome in spiteOf recollections clear and bright;Which yet do unto some impartAn undisturbed repose of heart.And all the assembly own a law Of orderly respect and awe;But see--they vanish one by one,And last, the Doe herself is gone.Harp! we have been full long beguiledBy vague thoughts, lured by fancies wild;To which, with no reluctant strings,Thou hast attuned thy murmurings;And now before this Pile we standIn solitude, and utter peace:But, Harp! thy murmurs may not cease-- A Spirit, with his angelic wings,In soft and breeze-like visitings,Has touched thee--and a Spirit\'s hand:A voice is with us--a commandTo chant, in strains of heavenly glory,A tale of tears, a mortal story!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto Seventh\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Powers there areThat touch each other to the quick--in modesWhich the gross world no sense hath to perceive,No soul to dream of.\'THOU Spirit, whose angelic handWas to the harp a strong command,Called the submissive strings to wakeIn glory for this Maiden\'s sake,Say, Spirit! whither hath she fledTo hide her poor afflicted head?What mighty forest in its gloomEnfolds her?--is a rifted tombWithin the wilderness her seat?Some island which the wild waves beat-- Is that the Sufferer\'s last retreat?Or some aspiring rock, that shroudsIts perilous front in mists and clouds?High-climbing rock, low sunless dale,Sea, desert, what do these avail?Oh take her anguish and her fearsInto a deep recess of years!\'Tis done;--despoil and desolationO\'er Rylstone\'s fair domain have blown;Pools, terraces, and walks are sown With weeds; the bowers are overthrown,Or have given way to slow mutation,While, in their ancient habitationThe Norton name hath been unknown.The lordly Mansion of its prideIs stripped; the ravage hath spread wideThrough park and field, a perishingThat mocks the gladness of the Spring!And, with this silent gloom agreeing,Appears a joyless human Being, Of aspect such as if the wasteWere under her dominion placed.Upon a primrose bank, her throneOf quietness, she sits alone;Among the ruins of a wood,Erewhile a covert bright and green,And where full many a brave tree stood,That used to spread its boughs, and ringWith the sweet bird\'s carolling.Behold her, like a virgin Queen, Neglecting in imperial stateThese outward images of fate,And carrying inward a sereneAnd perfect sway, through many a thoughtOf chance and change, that hath been broughtTo the subjection of a holy,Though stern and rigorous, melancholy!The like authority, with graceOf awfulness, is in her face,--There hath she fixed it; yet it seems To o\'ershadow by no native rightThat face, which cannot lose the gleams,Lose utterly the tender gleams,Of gentleness and meek delight,And loving-kindness ever bright:Such is her sovereign mien:--her dress(A vest with woollen cincture tied,A hood of mountain-wool undyed)Is homely,--fashioned to expressA wandering Pilgrim\'s humbleness. And she \'hath\' wandered, long and far,Beneath the light of sun and star;Hath roamed in trouble and in grief,Driven forward like a withered leaf,Yea like a ship at random blownTo distant places and unknown.But now she dares to seek a havenAmong her native wilds of Craven;Hath seen again her Father\'s roof,And put her fortitude to proof; The mighty sorrow hath been borne,And she is thoroughly forlorn:Her soul doth in itself stand fast,Sustained by memory of the pastAnd strength of Reason; held aboveThe infirmities of mortal love;Undaunted, lofty, calm, and stable,And awfully impenetrable.And so--beneath a mouldered tree,A self-surviving leafless oak By unregarded age from strokeOf ravage saved--sate Emily.There did she rest, with head reclined,Herself most like a stately flower,(Such have I seen) whom chance of birthHath separated from its kind,To live and die in a shady bower,Single on the gladsome earth.When, with a noise like distant thunder,A troop of deer came sweeping by; And, suddenly, behold a wonder!For One, among those rushing deer,A single One, in mid careerHath stopped, and fixed her large full eyeUpon the Lady Emily;A Doe most beautiful, clear-white,A radiant creature, silver-bright!Thus checked, a little while it stayed;A little thoughtful pause it made;And then advanced with stealth-like pace, Drew softly near her, and more near--Looked round--but saw no cause for fear;So to her feet the Creature came,And laid its head upon her knee,And looked into the Lady\'s face,A look of pure benignity,And fond unclouded memory.It is, thought Emily, the same,The very Doe of other years!--The pleading look the Lady viewed, And, by her gushing thoughts subdued,She melted into tears--A flood of tears, that flowed apace,Upon the happy Creature\'s face.Oh, moment ever blest! O PairBeloved of Heaven, Heaven\'s chosen care,This was for you a precious greeting;And may it prove a fruitful meeting!Joined are they, and the sylvan DoeCan she depart? can she forego The Lady, once her playful peer,And now her sainted Mistress dear?And will not Emily receiveThis lovely chronicler of thingsLong past, delights and sorrowings?Lone Sufferer! will not she believeThe promise in that speaking face;And welcome, as a gift of grace,The saddest thought the Creature brings?That day, the first of a re-union Which was to teem with high communion,That day of balmy April weather,They tarried in the wood together.And when, ere fall of evening dew,She from her sylvan haunt withdrew,The White Doe tracked with faithful paceThe Lady to her dwelling-place;That nook where, on paternal ground,A habitation she had found,The Master of whose humble board Once owned her Father for his Lord;A hut, by tufted trees defended,Where Rylstone brook with Wharf is blended.When Emily by morning lightWent forth, the Doe stood there in sight.She shrunk:--with one frail shock of painReceived and followed by a prayer,She saw the Creature once again;Shun will she not, she feels, will bear;--But, wheresoever she looked round, All now was trouble-haunted ground;And therefore now she deems it goodOnce more this restless neighbourhoodTo leave.--Unwooed, yet unforbidden,The White Doe followed up the vale,Up to another cottage, hiddenIn the deep fork of Amerdale;And there may Emily restoreHerself, in spots unseen before.--Why tell of mossy rock, or tree, By lurking Dernbrook\'s pathless side,Haunts of a strengthening amityThat calmed her, cheered, and fortified?For she hath ventured now to readOf time, and place, and thought, and deed--Endless history that liesIn her silent Follower\'s eyes;Who with a power like human reasonDiscerns the favourable season,Skilled to approach or to retire,-- From looks conceiving her desire;From look, deportment, voice, or mien,That vary to the heart within.If she too passionately wreathedHer arms, or over-deeply breathed,Walked quick or slowly, every moodIn its degree was understood;Then well may their accord be true,And kindliest intercourse ensue.--Oh! surely \'twas a gentle rousing When she by sudden glimpse espiedThe White Doe on the mountain browsing,Or in the meadow wandered wide!How pleased, when down the Straggler sankBeside her, on some sunny bank!How soothed, when in thick bower enclosed,They, like a nested pair, reposed!Fair Vision! when it crossed the MaidWithin some rocky cavern laid,The dark cave\'s portal gliding by, White as whitest cloud on highFloating through the azure sky.--What now is left for pain or fear?That Presence, dearer and more dear,While they, side by side, were straying,And the shepherd\'s pipe was playing,Did now a very gladness yieldAt morning to the dewy field,And with a deeper peace enduedThe hour of moonlight solitude. With her Companion, in such frameOf mind, to Rylstone back she came;And, ranging through the wasted groves,Received the memory of old loves,Undisturbed and undistrest,Into a soul which now was blestWith a soft spring-day of holy,Mild, and grateful, melancholy:Not sunless gloom or unenlightened,But by tender fancies brightened. When the bells of Rylstone playedTheir sabbath music--\'God us ayde!\'That was the sound they seemed to speak;Inscriptive legend which I weenMay on those holy bells be seen,That legend and her Grandsire\'s name;And oftentimes the Lady meekHad in her childhood read the same;Words which she slighted at that day;But now, when such sad change was wrought, And of that lonely name she thought--The bells of Rylstone seemed to say,While she sate listening in the shade,With vocal music, \'God us ayde;\'And all the hills were glad to bearTheir part in this effectual prayer.Nor lacked she Reason\'s firmest power;But with the White Doe at her sideUp would she climb to Norton Tower,And thence look round her far and wide, Her fate there measuring;--all is stilled,--The weak One hath subdued her heart;Behold the prophecy fulfilled,Fulfilled, and she sustains her part!But here her Brother\'s words have failed;Here hath a milder doom prevailed;That she, of him and all bereft,Hath yet this faithful Partner left;This one Associate, that disprovesHis words, remains for her, and loves. If tears are shed, they do not fallFor loss of him--for one, or all;Yet, sometimes, sometimes doth she weepMoved gently in her soul\'s soft sleep;A few tears down her cheek descendFor this her last and living Friend.Bless, tender Hearts, their mutual lot,And bless for both this savage spot;Which Emily doth sacred holdFor reasons dear and manifold-- Here hath she, here before her sight,Close to the summit of this height,The grassy rock-encircled PoundIn which the Creature first was found.So beautiful the timid Thrall(A spotless Youngling white as foam)Her youngest Brother brought it home;The youngest, then a lusty boy,Bore it, or led, to Rylstone-hallWith heart brimful of pride and joy! But most to Bolton\'s sacred Pile,On favouring nights, she loved to go;There ranged through cloister, court, and aisle,Attended by the soft-paced Doe;Nor feared she in the still moonshineTo look upon Saint Mary\'s shrine;Nor on the lonely turf that showedWhere Francis slept in his last abode.For that she came; there oft she sateForlorn, but not disconsolate: And, when she from the abyss returnedOf thought, she neither shrunk nor mourned;Was happy that she lived to greetHer mute Companion as it layIn love and pity at her feet;How happy in its turn to meetThe recognition! the mild glanceBeamed from that gracious countenance;Communication, like the rayOf a new morning, to the nature And prospects of the inferior Creature!A mortal Song we sing, by dowerEncouraged of celestial power;Power which the viewless Spirit shedBy whom we were first visited;Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wingsSwept like a breeze the conscious strings,When, left in solitude, erewhileWe stood before this ruined Pile,And, quitting unsubstantial dreams, Sang in this Presence kindred themes;Distress and desolation spreadThrough human hearts, and pleasure dead,--Dead--but to live again on earth,A second and yet nobler birth;Dire overthrow, and yet how highThe re-ascent in sanctity!From fair to fairer; day by dayA more divine and loftier way!Even such this blessed Pilgrim trod, By sorrow lifted towards her God;Uplifted to the purest skyOf undisturbed mortality.Her own thoughts loved she; and could bendA dear look to her lowly Friend;There stopped; her thirst was satisfiedWith what this innocent spring supplied:Her sanction inwardly she bore,And stood apart from human cares:But to the world returned no more, Although with no unwilling mindHelp did she give at need, and joinedThe Wharfdale peasants in their prayers.At length, thus faintly, faintly tiedTo earth, she was set free, and died.Thy soul, exalted Emily,Maid of the blasted family,Rose to the God from whom it came!--In Rylstone Church her mortal frameWas buried by her Mother\'s side. Most glorious sunset! and a raySurvives--the twilight of this day--In that fair Creature whom the fieldsSupport, and whom the forest shields;Who, having filled a holy place,Partakes, in her degree, Heaven\'s grace;And bears a memory and a mindRaised far above the law of kind;Haunting the spots with lonely cheerWhich her dear Mistress once held dear: Loves most what Emily loved most--The enclosure of this churchyard ground;Here wanders like a gliding ghost,And every sabbath here is found;Comes with the people when the bellsAre heard among the moorland dells,Finds entrance through yon arch, where wayLies open on the sabbath-day;Here walks amid the mournful wasteOf prostrate altars, shrines defaced, And floors encumbered with rich showOf fret-work imagery laid low;Paces softly, or makes halt,By fractured cell, or tomb, or vault;By plate of monumental brassDim-gleaming among weeds and grass,And sculptured Forms of Warriors brave:But chiefly by that single grave,That one sequestered hillock green,The pensive visitant is seen. There doth the gentle Creature lieWith those adversities unmoved;Calm spectacle, by earth and skyIn their benignity approved!And aye, methinks, this hoary Pile,Subdued by outrage and decay,Looks down upon her with a smile,A gracious smile, that seems to say--\'Thou, thou art not a Child of Time,But Daughter of the Eternal Prime!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Recluse  -  Book First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHOME AT GRASMEREONCE to the verge of yon steep barrier cameA roving school-boy; what the adventurer\'s ageHath now escaped his memory--but the hour,One of a golden summer holiday,He well remembers, though the year be gone--Alone and devious from afar he came;And, with a sudden influx overpoweredAt sight of this seclusion, he forgotHis haste, for hasty had his footsteps beenAs boyish his pursuits; and sighing said, \'What happy fortune were it here to live!And, if a thought of dying, if a thoughtOf mortal separation, could intrudeWith paradise before him, here to die!\'No Prophet was he, had not even a hope,Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,A fancy in the heart of what might beThe lot of others, never could be his.The station whence he looked was soft and green,Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth Of vale below, a height of hills above.For rest of body perfect was the spot,All that luxurious nature could desire;But stirring to the spirit; who could gazeAnd not feel motions there? He thought of cloudsThat sail on winds: of breezes that delightTo play on water, or in endless chasePursue each other through the yielding plainOf grass or corn, over and through and through,In billow after billow, evermore Disporting--nor unmindful was the boyOf sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds;Of fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays,Genii, and winged angels that are LordsWithout restraint of all which they behold.The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he feltThat such unfettered liberty was his,Such power and joy; but only for this end,To flit from field to rock, from rock to field,From shore to island, and from isle to shore, From open ground to covert, from a bedOf meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood;From high to low, from low to high, yet stillWithin the bound of this huge concave; hereMust be his home, this valley be his world.Since that day forth the Place to him--\'to me\'(For I who live to register the truthWas that same young and happy Being) becameAs beautiful to thought, as it had beenWhen present, to the bodily sense; a haunt Of pure affections, shedding upon joyA brighter joy; and through such damp and gloomOf the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youthMistakes for sorrow, darting beams of lightThat no self-cherished sadness could withstand;And now \'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,Beloved Grasmere (let the wandering streamsTake up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name)One of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home.And was the cost so great? and could it seem An act of courage, and the thing itselfA conquest? who must bear the blame? Sage manThy prudence, thy experience, thy desires,Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.Yes the realities of life so cold,So cowardly, so ready to betray,So stinted in the measure of their graceAs we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,Have been to me more bountiful than hope,Less timid than desire--but that is past. On Nature\'s invitation do I come,By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead,That made the calmest fairest spot of earthWith all its unappropriated goodMy own; and not mine only, for with meEntrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,A younger Orphan of a home extinct,The only Daughter of my Parents dwells.Ay, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir, Pause upon that and let the breathing frameNo longer breathe, but all be satisfied.--Oh, if such silence be not thanks to GodFor what hath been bestowed, then where, where thenShall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne\'erFix on a lovely object, nor my mindTake pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,But either She whom now I have, who nowDivides with me this loved abode, was there,Or not far off. Where\'er my footsteps turned, Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,The thought of her was like a flash of light,Or an unseen companionship, a breathOf fragrance independent of the Wind.In all my goings, in the new and oldOf all my meditations, and in thisFavourite of all, in this the most of all.--What being, therefore, since the birth of ManHad ever more abundant cause to speakThanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse Make him more thankful, then to call on VerseTo aid him and in song resound his joy?The boon is absolute; surpassing graceTo me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowersOf blissful Eden this was neither givenNor could be given, possession of the goodWhich had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,And dear Imaginations realised,Up to their highest measure, yea and more.Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in; Now in the clear and open day I feelYour guardianship; I take it to my heart;\'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.But I would call thee beautiful, for mild,And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou artDear Valley, having in thy face a smileThough peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,Pleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake,Its one green island and its winding shores;The multitude of little rocky hills, Thy Church and cottages of mountain stoneClustered like stars some few, but single most,And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,Or glancing at each other cheerful looksLike separated stars with clouds between.What want we? have we not perpetual streams,Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,And thickets full of songsters, and the voiceOf lordly birds, an unexpected sound Heard now and then from morn to latest eve,Admonishing the man who walks belowOf solitude and silence in the sky?These have we, and a thousand nooks of earthHave also these, but nowhere else is found,Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be foundThe one sensation that is here; \'tis here,Here as it found its way into my heartIn childhood, here as it abides by day,By night, here only; or in chosen minds That take it with them hence, where\'er they go.--\'Tis, but I cannot name it, \'tis the senseOf majesty, and beauty, and repose,A blended holiness of earth and sky,Something that makes this individual spot,This small abiding-place of many men,A termination, and a last retreat,A centre, come from wheresoe\'er you will,A whole without dependence or defect,Made for itself, and happy in itself, Perfect contentment, Unity entire.Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,When hitherward we journeyed side by sideThrough burst of sunshine and through flying showers;Paced the long vales--how long they were--and yetHow fast that length of way was left behind,Wensley\'s rich Vale, and Sedbergh\'s naked heights.The frosty wind, as if to make amendsFor its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,And drove us onward like two ships at sea, Or like two birds, companions in mid-air,Parted and reunited by the blast.Stern was the face of nature; we rejoicedIn that stern countenance, for our souls thence drewA feeling of their strength. The naked trees,The icy brooks, as on we passed, appearedTo question us. \'Whence come ye, to what end?\'They seemed to say, \'What would ye,\' said the shower,\'Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?\'The sunbeam said, \'Be happy.\' When this vale We entered, bright and solemn was the skyThat faced us with a passionate welcoming,And led us to our threshold. Daylight failedInsensibly, and round us gently fellComposing darkness, with a quiet loadOf full contentment, in a little shedDisturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,And wondering at its new inhabitants.It loves us now, this Vale so beautifulBegins to love us! by a sullen storm, Two months unwearied of severest storm,It put the temper of our minds to proof,And found us faithful through the gloom, and heardThe poet mutter his prelusive songsWith cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joyAmong the silence of the woods and hills;Silent to any gladsomeness of soundWith all their shepherds.But the gates of SpringAre opened; churlish winter hath given leaveThat she should entertain for this one day, Perhaps for many genial days to come,His guests, and make them jocund.--They are pleased,But most of all the birds that haunt the floodWith the mild summons; inmates though they beOf Winter\'s household, they keep festivalThis day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;They show their pleasure, and shall I do less?Happier of happy though I be, like themI cannot take possession of the sky,Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there One of a mighty multitude, whose wayIs a perpetual harmony and danceMagnificent. Behold how with a graceOf ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seemInferior to angelical, they prolongTheir curious pastime, shaping in mid-air,And sometimes with ambitious wing that soarsHigh as the level of the mountain tops,A circuit ampler than the lake beneath,Their own domain;--but ever, while intent On tracing and retracing that large round,Their jubilant activity evolvesHundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,Upwards and downwards; progress intricateYet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayedTheir indefatigable flight. \'Tis done,Ten times and more I fancied it had ceased,But lo! the vanished company againAscending, they approach. I hear their wingsFaint, faint at first; and then an eager sound Passed in a moment--and as faint again!They tempt the sun to sport among their plumes;Tempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice,To show them a fair image,--\'tis themselves,Their own fair forms upon the glimmering plainPainted more soft and fair as they descend,Almost to touch,--then up again aloft,Up with a sally and a flash of speed,As if they scorned both resting-place and rest!--This day is a thanksgiving, \'tis a day Of glad emotion and deep quietness;Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,The penetrating bliss; oh surely theseHave felt it, not the happy choirs of spring,Her own peculiar family of loveThat sport among green leaves, a blither train!But two are missing, two, a lonely pairOf milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seenPartaking this day\'s pleasure? From afar They came, to sojourn here in solitude,Choosing this Valley, they who had the choiceOf the whole world. We saw them day by day,Through those two months of unrelenting storm,Conspicuous at the centre of the LakeTheir safe retreat, we knew them well, I guessThat the whole valley knew them; but to usThey were more dear than may be well believed,Not only for their beauty, and their stillAnd placid way of life, and constant love Inseparable, not for these alone,But that \'their\' state so much resembled ours,They having also chosen this abode;They strangers, and we strangers, they a pair,And we a solitary pair like them.They should not have departed; many daysDid I look forth in vain, nor on the wingCould see them, nor in that small open spaceOf blue unfrozen water, where they lodgedAnd lived so long in quiet, side by side. Shall we behold them consecrated friends,Faithful companions, yet another yearSurviving, they for us, and we for them,And neither pair be broken? nay perchanceIt is too late already for such hope;The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,And parted them; or haply both are goneOne death, and that were mercy given to both.Recall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive,Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh Of such inhospitable penaltyInflicted upon confidence so pure.Ah! if I wished to follow where the sightOf all that is before my eyes, the voiceWhich speaks from a presiding spirit here,Would lead me, I should whisper to myself:They who are dwellers in this holy placeMust needs themselves be hallowed, they requireNo benediction from the stranger\'s lips,For they are blessed already; none would give The greeting \'peace be with you\' unto them,For peace they have; it cannot but be theirs,And mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these--\'Their\' healing offices a pure good-willPrecludes, and charity beyond the boundsOf charity--an overflowing love;Not for the creature only, but for allThat is around them; love for everythingWhich in their happy Region they behold!Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought Is passed, we blame it not for having come.--What if I floated down a pleasant stream,And now am landed, and the motion gone,Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the streamIs flowing, and will never cease to flow,And I shall float upon that stream again.By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,Words cannot say how beautiful: then hail,Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,Delightful Valley, habitation fair! And to whatever else of outward formCan give an inward help, can purify,And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,And steal away, and for a while deceiveAnd lap in pleasing rest, and bear us onWithout desire in full complacency,Contemplating perfection absolute,And entertained as in a placid sleep.But not betrayed by tenderness of mindThat feared, or wholly overlooked the truth, Did we come hither, with romantic hopeTo find in midst of so much lovelinessLove, perfect love: of so much majestyA like majestic-frame of mind in thoseWho here abide, the persons like the place.Not from such hope, or aught of such belief,Hath issued any portion of the joyWhich I have felt this day. An awful voice\'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard,Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields, Shout after shout--reiterated whoop,In manner of a bird that takes delightIn answering to itself: or like a houndSingle at chase among the lonely woods,His yell repeating; yet it was in truthA human voice--a spirit of coming night;How solemn when the sky is dark, and earthNot dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snowMade visible, amid a noise of windsAnd bleatings manifold of mountain sheep, Which in that iteration recogniseTheir summons, and are gathering round for food,Devoured with keenness, ere to grove or bankOr rocky bield with patience they retire.That very voice, which, in some timid moodOf superstitious fancy, might have seemedAwful as ever stray demoniac uttered,His steps to govern in the wilderness;Or as the Norman Curfew\'s regular beatTo hearths when first they darkened at the knell: That shepherd\'s voice, it may have reached mine earDebased and under profanation, madeThe ready organ of articulate soundsFrom ribaldry, impiety, or wrath,Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawlsOf some abused Festivity--so be it.I came not dreaming of unruffled life,Untainted manners; born among the hills,Bred also there, I wanted not a scaleTo regulate my hopes; pleased with the good I shrink not from the evil with disgust,Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man,The common creature of the brotherhood,Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,For selfishness and envy and revenge,Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.Yet is it something gained, it is in truthA mighty gain, that Labour here preservesHis rosy face, a servant only here Of the fireside or of the open field,A Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired:That extreme penury is here unknown,And cold and hunger\'s abject wretchednessMortal to body and the heaven-born mind:That they who want are not too great a weightFor those who can relieve; here may the heartBreathe in the air of fellow-sufferingDreadless, as in a kind of fresher breezeOf her own native element, the hand Be ready and unwearied without plea,From tasks too frequent or beyond its power,For languor or indifference or despair.And as these lofty barriers break the forceOf winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in partConceal us from the storm, so here abidesA power and a protection for the mind,Dispensed indeed to other solitudesFavoured by noble privilege like this,Where kindred independence of estate Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,He, happy man! is master of the field,And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod.Not less than halfway up yon mountain\'s side,Behold a dusky spot, a grove of FirsThat seems still smaller than it is; this groveIs haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spiritOf memory faithful to the call of love;For, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends upYon curling smoke from the grey cot below, The trees (her first-born child being then a babe)Were planted by her husband and herself,That ranging o\'er the high and houseless groundTheir sheep might neither want from perilous stormOf winter, nor from summer\'s sultry heat,A friendly covert; \'and they knew it well,\'Said she, \'for thither as the trees grew upWe to the patient creatures carried foodIn times of heavy snow.\' She then beganIn fond obedience to her private thoughts To speak of her dead husband; is there notAn art, a music, and a strain of wordsThat shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life,Shall speak of what is done among the fields,Done truly there, or felt, of solid goodAnd real evil, yet be sweet withal,More grateful, more harmonious than the breath,The idle breath of softest pipe attunedTo pastoral fancies? Is there such a streamPure and unsullied flowing from the heart With motions of true dignity and grace?Or must we seek that stream where Man is not?Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,Delicious as the gentlest breeze that soundsThrough that aerial fir-grove--could preserveSome portion of its human historyAs gathered from the Matron\'s lips, and tellOf tears that have been shed at sight of it,And moving dialogues between this PairWho in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while theyNo longer flourish, he entirely gone,She withering in her loneliness. Be thisA task above my skill--the silent mindHas her own treasures, and I think of these,Love what I see, and honour humankind.No, we are not alone, we do not stand,My sister here misplaced and desolate,Loving what no one cares for but ourselves,We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks Of this fair Vale, and o\'er its spacious heights,Unprofitable kindliness, bestowedOn objects unaccustomed to the giftsOf feeling, which were cheerless and forlornBut few weeks past, and would be so againWere we not here; we do not tend a lampWhose lustre we alone participate,Which shines dependent upon us alone,Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.Look where we will, some human hand has been Before us with its offering; not a treeSprinkles these little pastures, but the sameHath furnished matter for a thought; perchanceFor some one serves as a familiar friend.Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,Home of untutored shepherds as it is,Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deemThese feelings, though subservient more than oursTo every day\'s demand for daily bread, And borrowing more their spirit and their shapeFrom self-respecting interests; deem them notUnworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no,They lift the animal being, do themselvesBy nature\'s kind and ever-present aidRefine the selfishness from which they spring,Redeem by love the individual senseOf anxiousness, with which they are combined.And thus it is that fitly they becomeAssociates in the joy of purest minds: They blend therewith congenially: meanwhileCalmly they breathe their own undying lifeThrough this their mountain sanctuary; longOh long may it remain inviolate,Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,And giving to the moments as they passTheir little boons of animating thoughtThat sweeten labour, make it seen and feltTo be no arbitrary weight imposed,But a glad function natural to man. Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,Already have I gained; the inward frame,Though slowly opening, opens every dayWith process not unlike to that which cheersA pensive stranger journeying at his leisureThrough some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mistsBreak up and are beginning to recede;How pleased he is where thin and thinner growsThe veil, or where it parts at once, to spyThe dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads; To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed;Then to be greeted by the scattered hutsAs they shine out; and \'see\' the streams whose murmurHad soothed his ear while \'they\' were hidden; how pleasedTo have about him which way e\'er he goesSomething on every side concealed from view,In every quarter something visibleHalf seen or wholly, lost and found again,Alternate progress and impediment,And yet a growing prospect in the main. Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,Herein less happy than the Traveller,To cast from time to time a painful lookUpon unwelcome things which unawaresReveal themselves, not therefore is my heartDepressed, nor does it fear what is to come;But confident, enriched at every glance,The more I see the more delight my mindReceives, or by reflection can create:Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?Nor let me pass unheeded other lovesWhere no fear is, and humbler sympathies.Already hath sprung up within my heartA liking for the small grey horse that bearsThe paralytic man, and for the bruteIn Scripture sanctified--the patient bruteOn which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.The famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale, Though yet to me a stranger, will not beA stranger long; nor will the blind man\'s guide,Meek and neglected thing, of no renown!Soon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fadesFriends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrushTo rouse me, and a hundred warblers more!And if those Eagles to their ancient holdReturn, Helvellyn\'s Eagles! with the PairFrom my own door I shall be free to claimAcquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud. The owl that gives the name to Owlet-CragHave I heard whooping, and he soon will beA chosen one of my regards. See thereThe heifer in yon little croft belongsTo one who holds it dear; with duteous careShe reared it, and in speaking of her chargeI heard her scatter some endearing wordsDomestic, and in spirit motherly,She being herself a mother; happy Beast,If the caresses of a human voice Can make it so, and care of human hands.And ye as happy under Nature\'s care,Strangers to me and all men, or at leastStrangers to all particular amity,All intercourse of knowledge or of loveThat parts the individual from his kind.Whether in large communities ye keepFrom year to year, not shunning man\'s abode,A settled residence, or be from farWild creatures, and of many homes, that come The gift of winds, and whom the winds againTake from us at your pleasure; yet shall yeNot want for this your own subordinate placeIn my affections. Witness the delightWith which erewhile I saw that multitudeWheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,Yet not at rest upon the glassy lake:They \'cannot\' rest--they gambol like young whelps;Active as lambs, and overcome with joyThey try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge, And beat the passive water with their wings.Too distant are they for plain view, but lo!Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun,Betray their occupation, rising upFirst one and then another silver spout,As one or other takes the fit of glee,Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guiseOf plaything fireworks, that on festal nightsSparkle about the feet of wanton boys.--How vast the compass of this theatre, Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pompAnd silent majesty; the birch-tree woodsAre hung with thousand thousand diamond dropsOf melted hoar-frost, every tiny knotIn the bare twigs, each little budding-placeCased with its several beads; what myriads theseUpon one tree, while all the distant grove,That rises to the summit of the steep,Shows like a mountain built of silver light:See yonder the same pageant, and again Behold the universal imageryInverted, all its sun-bright features touchedAs with the varnish and the gloss of dreams.Dreamlike the blending also of the wholeHarmonious landscape: all along the shoreThe boundary lost--the line invisibleThat parts the image from reality;And the clear hills, as high as they ascendHeavenward, so deep piercing the lake below.Admonished of the days of love to come The raven croaks, and fills the upper airWith a strange sound of genial harmony;And in and all about that playful band,Incapable although they be of rest,And in their fashion very rioters,There is a stillness, and they seem to makeCalm revelry in that their calm abode.Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass,Pass with a thought the life of the whole yearThat is to come: the throng of woodland flowers And lilies that will dance upon the waves.Say boldly then that solitude is notWhere these things are: he truly is alone,He of the multitude whose eyes are doomedTo hold a vacant commerce day by dayWith Objects wanting life--repelling love;He by the vast metropolis immured,Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls,Where numbers overwhelm humanity,And neighbourhood serves rather to divide Than to unite--what sighs more deep than his,Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;Who must inhabit under a black skyA city, where, if indifference to disgustYield not to scorn or sorrow, living menAre ofttimes to their fellow-men no moreThan to the forest Hermit are the leavesThat hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less,For they protect his walk from sun and shower,Swell his devotion with their voice in storms, And whisper while the stars twinkle among themHis lullaby. From crowded streets remote,Far from the living and dead WildernessOf the thronged world, Society is hereA true community--a genuine frameOf many into one incorporate.\'That\' must be looked for here: paternal sway,One household, under God, for high and low,One family and one mansion; to themselvesAppropriate, and divided from the world, As if it were a cave, a multitudeHuman and brute, possessors undisturbedOf this Recess--their legislative Hall,Their Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place.Dismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams,All golden fancies of the golden age,The bright array of shadowy thoughts from timesThat were before all time, or are to beEre time expire, the pageantry that stirsOr will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed On lovely objects, and we wish to partWith all remembrance of a jarring world,--Take we at once this one sufficient hope,What need of more? that we shall neither droopNor pine for want of pleasure in the lifeScattered about us, nor through want of aughtThat keeps in health the insatiable mind.--That we shall have for knowledge and for loveAbundance, and that feeling as we doHow goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure From all reproach is yon ethereal vault,And this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart,By which and under which we are enclosedTo breathe in peace; we shall moreover find(If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,If rightly we observe and justly weigh)The inmates not unworthy of their home,The Dwellers of their Dwelling.And if thisWere otherwise, we have within ourselvesEnough to fill the present day with joy, And overspread the future years with hope,Our beautiful and quiet home, enrichedAlready with a stranger whom we loveDeeply, a stranger of our Father\'s house,A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,Who finds at last an hour to his contentBeneath our roof. And others whom we loveWill seek us also, Sisters of our hearts,And one, like them, a Brother of our hearts,Philosopher and Poet, in whose sight These mountains will rejoice with open joy.--Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we areAnd must be, with God\'s will, a happy Band.Yet \'tis not to enjoy that we exist,For that end only; something must be done:I must not walk in unreproved delightThese narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,No duty that looks further, and no care.Each Being has his office, lowly someAnd common, yet all worthy if fulfilled With zeal, acknowledgment that with the giftKeeps pace a harvest answering to the seed.Of ill-advised Ambition and of PrideI would stand clear, but yet to me I feelThat an internal brightness is vouchsafedThat must not die, that must not pass away.Why does this inward lustre fondly seekAnd gladly blend with outward fellowship?Why do \'they\' shine around me whom I love?Why do they teach me, whom I thus revere? Strange question, yet it answers not itself.That humble Roof embowered among the trees,That calm fireside, it is not even in them,Blest as they are, to furnish a replyThat satisfies and ends in perfect rest.Possessions have I that are solely mine,Something within which yet is shared by none,Not even the nearest to me and most dear,Something which power and effort may impart;I would impart it, I would spread it wide: Immortal in the world which is to come--Forgive me if I add another claim--And would not wholly perish even in this,Lie down and be forgotten in the dust,I and the modest Partners of my daysMaking a silent company in death;Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights,All buried with me without monumentOr profit unto any but ourselves!It must not be, if I, divinely taught, Be privileged to speak as I have feltOf what in man is human or divine.While yet an innocent little one, with a heartThat doubtless wanted not its tender moods,I breathed (for this I better recollect)Among wild appetites and blind desires,Motions of savage instinct my delightAnd exaltation. Nothing at that timeSo welcome, no temptation half so dearAs that which urged me to a daring feat, Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,And tottering towers: I loved to stand and readTheir looks forbidding, read and disobey,Sometimes in act and evermore in thought.With impulses, that scarcely were by theseSurpassed in strength, I heard of danger metOr sought with courage; enterprise forlornBy one, sole keeper of his own intent,Or by a resolute few, who for the sakeOf glory fronted multitudes in arms. Yea, to this hour I cannot read a TaleOf two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,And fighting to the death, but I am pleasedMore than a wise man ought to be; I wish,Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there.But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seekFor other agitations, or be calm;Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,Some nursling of the mountains which she leadsThrough quiet meadows, after he has learnt His strength, and had his triumph and his joy,His desperate course of tumult and of glee.That which in stealth by Nature was performedHath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate VoiceHath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things,Thy glory and thy happiness be there.Nor fear, though thou confide in me, a wantOf aspirations that have been--of foesTo wrestle with, and victory to complete,Bounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored; All that inflamed thy infant heart, the love,The longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest,All shall survive, though changed their office, allShall live, it is not in their power to die.Then farewell to the Warrior\'s Schemes, farewellThe forwardness of soul which looks that wayUpon a less incitement than the CauseOf Liberty endangered, and farewellThat other hope, long mine, the hope to fillThe heroic trumpet with the Muse\'s breath! Yet in this peaceful Vale we will not spendUnheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought,A voice shall speak, and what will be the theme?On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life,Musing in solitude, I oft perceiveFair trains of imagery before me rise,Accompanied by feelings of delightPure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed;And I am conscious of affecting thoughtsAnd dear remembrances, whose presence soothes Or elevates the Mind, intent to weighThe good and evil of our mortal state.--To these emotions, whencesoe\'er they come,Whether from breath of outward circumstance,Or from the Soul--an impulse to herself--I would give utterance in numerous verse.Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope,And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith;Of blessed consolations in distress;Of moral strength, and intellectual Power; Of joy in widest commonalty spread;Of the individual Mind that keeps her ownInviolate retirement, subject thereTo Conscience only, and the law supremeOf that Intelligence which governs all--I sing:--\'fit audience let me find though few!\'So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--In holiest mood. Urania, I shall needThy guidance, or a greater Muse, if suchDescend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!

For all--all dying in one hour!--Why comes not Francis? Thoughts of loveShould bear him to his Sister dearWith the fleet motion of a dove;Yea, like a heavenly messengerOf speediest wing, should he appear.Why comes he not?--for westward fastAlong the plain of York he past;Reckless of what impels or leads,Unchecked he hurries on;--nor heeds The sorrow, through the Villages,Spread by triumphant crueltiesOf vengeful military force,And punishment without remorse.He marked not, heard not, as he fledAll but the suffering heart was deadFor him abandoned to blank awe,To vacancy, and horror strong:And the first object which he saw,With conscious sight, as he swept along-- It was the Banner in his hand!He felt--and made a sudden stand.He looked about like one betrayed:What hath he done? what promise made?Oh weak, weak moment! to what endCan such a vain oblation tend,And he the Bearer?--Can he goCarrying this instrument of woe,And find, find anywhere, a rightTo excuse him in his Country\'s sight? No; will not all men deem the changeA downward course, perverse and strange?Here is it;--but how? when? must she,The unoffending Emily,Again this piteous object see?Such conflict long did he maintain,Nor liberty nor rest could gain:His own life into danger broughtBy this sad burden--even that thought,Exciting self-suspicion strong Swayed the brave man to his wrong.And how--unless it were the senseOf all-disposing Providence,Its will unquestionably shown--How has the Banner clung so fastTo a palsied, and unconscious hand;Clung to the hand to which it passedWithout impediment? And why,But that Heaven\'s purpose might be known,Doth now no hindrance meet his eye, No intervention, to withstandFulfilment of a Father\'s prayerBreathed to a Son forgiven, and blestWhen all resentments were at rest,And life in death laid the heart bare?--Then, like a spectre sweeping by,Rushed through his mind the prophecyOf utter desolation madeTo Emily in the yew-tree shade:He sighed, submitting will and power To the stern embrace of that grasping hour.\'No choice is left, the deed is mine--Dead are they, dead!--and I will go,And, for their sakes, come weal or woe,Will lay the Relic on the shrine.\'So forward with a steady willHe went, and traversed plain and hill;And up the vale of Wharf his wayPursued;--and, at the dawn of day,Attained a summit whence his eyes Could see the Tower of Bolton rise.There Francis for a moment\'s spaceMade halt--but hark! a noise behindOf horsemen at an eager pace!He heard, and with misgiving mind.--\'Tis Sir George Bowes who leads the Band:They come, by cruel Sussex sent;Who, when the Nortons from the handOf death had drunk their punishment,Bethought him, angry and ashamed, How Francis, with the Banner claimedAs his own charge, had disappeared,By all the standers-by revered.His whole bold carriage (which had quelledThus far the Opposer, and repelledAll censure, enterprise so brightThat even bad men had vainly strivenAgainst that overcoming light)Was then reviewed, and prompt word given,That to what place soever fled He should be seized, alive or dead.The troop of horse have gained the heightWhere Francis stood in open sight.They hem him round--\'Behold the proof,\'They cried, \'the Ensign in his hand!\'He\' did not arm, he walked aloof!For why?--to save his Father\'s land;--Worst Traitor of them all is he,A Traitor dark and cowardly!\'\'I am no Traitor,\' Francis said, \'Though this unhappy freight I bear;And must not part with.

\'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,And Benjamin, without a question,Taking her for some way-worn rover,Said, \'Mount, and get you under cover!\'Another voice, in tone as hoarseAs a swoln brook with rugged course,Cried out, \'Good brother, why so fast?I\'ve had a glimpse of you--\'avast!\'Or, since it suits you to be civil,Take her at once--for good and evil!\' \'It is my Husband,\' softly saidThe Woman, as if half afraid:By this time she was snug within,Through help of honest Benjamin;She and her Babe, which to her breastWith thankfulness the Mother pressed;And now the same strong voice more nearSaid cordially, \'My Friend, what cheer?Rough doings these!

The past he calmly hath reviewed:But where will be the fortitudeOf this brave man, when he shall seeThat Form beneath the spreading tree,And know that it is Emily?He saw her where in open viewShe sate beneath the spreading yew--Her head upon her lap, concealingIn solitude her bitter feeling:\'Might ever son \'command\' a sire, The act were justified to-day.\'This to himself--and to the Maid,Whom now he had approached, he said--\'Gone are they,--they have their desire;And I with thee one hour will stay,To give thee comfort if I may.\'She heard, but looked not up, nor spake;And sorrow moved him to partakeHer silence; then his thoughts turned round,And fervent words a passage found. \'Gone are they, bravely, though misled;With a dear Father at their head!The Sons obey a natural lord;The Father had given solemn wordTo noble Percy; and a forceStill stronger, bends him to his course.This said, our tears to-day may fallAs at an innocent funeral.In deep and awful channel runsThis sympathy of Sire and Sons; Untried our Brothers have been lovedWith heart by simple nature moved;And now their faithfulness is proved:For faithful we must call them, bearingThat soul of conscientious daring.--There were they all in circle--thereStood Richard, Ambrose, Christopher,John with a sword that will not fail,And Marmaduke in fearless mail,And those bright Twins were side by side; And there, by fresh hopes beautified,Stood He, whose arm yet lacks the powerOf man, our youngest, fairest flower!I, by the right of eldest born,And in a second father\'s place,Presumed to grapple with their scorn,And meet their pity face to face;Yea, trusting in God\'s holy aid,I to my Father knelt and prayed;And one, the pensive Marmaduke, Methought, was yielding inwardly,And would have laid his purpose by,But for a glance of his Father\'s eye,Which I myself could scarcely brook.Then be we, each and all, forgiven!Thou, chiefly thou, my Sister dear,Whose pangs are registered in heaven--The stifled sigh, the hidden tear,And smiles, that dared to take their place,Meek filial smiles, upon thy face, As that unhallowed Banner grewBeneath a loving old Man\'s view.Thy part is done--thy painful part;Be thou then satisfied in heart!A further, though far easier, taskThan thine hath been, my duties ask;With theirs my efforts cannot blend,I cannot for such cause contend;Their aims I utterly forswear;But I in body will be there.

Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene,Involved and restless all--a scenePregnant with mutual exaltation,Rich change, and multiplied creation!This sight to me the Muse imparts;--And then, what kindness in their hearts!What tears of rapture, what vow-making,Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!What solemn, vacant, interlacing,As if they\'d fall asleep embracing! Then, in the turbulence of glee,And in the excess of amity,Says Benjamin, \'That Ass of thine,He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:If he were tethered to the waggon,He\'d drag as well what he is dragging,And we, as brother should with brother,Might trudge it alongside each other!\'Forthwith, obedient to command,The horses made a quiet stand; And to the waggon\'s skirts was tiedThe Creature, by the Mastiff\'s side,The Mastiff wondering, and perplextWith dread of what will happen next;And thinking it but sorry cheer,To have such company so near!This new arrangement made, the WainThrough the still night proceeds again;No Moon hath risen her light to lend;But indistinctly may be kenned The VANGUARD, following close behind,Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!\'Thy wife and child are snug and warm,Thy ship will travel without harm;I like,\' said Benjamin, \'her shape and stature:And this of mine--this bulky creatureOf which I have the steering--this,Seen fairly, is not much amiss!We want your streamers, friend, you know;But, altogether as we go, We make a kind of handsome show!Among these hills, from first to last,We\'ve weathered many a furious blast;Hard passage forcing on, with headAgainst the storm, and canvas spread.I hate a boaster; but to theeWill say\'t, who know\'st both land and sea,The unluckiest hulk that stems the brineIs hardly worse beset than mine,When cross-winds on her quarter beat; And, fairly lifted from my feet,I stagger onward--heaven knows how;But not so pleasantly as now:Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,And many a foundrous pit surrounded!Yet here we are, by night and dayGrinding through rough and smooth our way;Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;And long shall be so yet--God willing!\'\'Ay,\' said the Tar, \'through fair and foul-- But save us from yon screeching owl!\'That instant was begun a frayWhich called their thoughts another way:The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!What must he do but growl and snarl,Still more and more dissatisfiedWith the meek comrade at his side!Till, not incensed though put to proof,The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,Salutes the Mastiff on the head; And so were better manners bred,And all was calmed and quieted.\'Yon screech-owl,\' says the Sailor, turningBack to his former cause of mourning,\'Yon owl!--pray God that all be well!\'Tis worse than any funeral bell;As sure as I\'ve the gift of sight,We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!\'--Said Benjamin, \'This whip shall layA thousand, if they cross our way. I know that Wanton\'s noisy station,I know him and his occupation;The jolly bird hath learned his cheerUpon the banks of Windermere;Where a tribe of them make merry,Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;Hallooing from an open throat,Like travellers shouting for a boat.--The tricks he learned at WindermereThis vagrant owl is playing here-- That is the worst of his employment:He\'s at the top of his enjoyment!\'This explanation stilled the alarm,Cured the foreboder like a charm;This, and the manner, and the voice,Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;His heart is up--he fears no evilFrom life or death, from man or devil;He wheels--and, making many stops,Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops; And, while he talked of blows and scars,Benjamin, among the stars,Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;Such retreating and advancingAs, I ween, was never seenIn bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Mary\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLet other bards of angels sing, Bright suns without a spot; But thou art no such perfect thing: Rejoice that thou art not!

Then, too, this Song \'of mine\' once more could please,Where anguish, strange as dreams of restless sleep,Is tempered and allayed by sympathiesAloft ascending, and descending deep,Even to the inferior Kinds; whom forest-treesProtect from beating sunbeams, and the sweepOf the sharp winds;--fair Creatures!--to whom HeavenA calm and sinless life, with love, hath given.This tragic Story cheered us; for it speaksOf female patience winning firm repose; And, of the recompense that conscience seeks,A bright, encouraging, example shows;Needful when o\'er wide realms the tempest breaks,Needful amid life\'s ordinary woes;--Hence, not for them unfitted who would blessA happy hour with holier happiness.He serves the Muses erringly and ill,Whose aim is pleasure light and fugitive:Oh, that my mind were equal to fulfilThe comprehensive mandate which they give-- Vain aspiration of an earnest will!Yet in this moral Strain a power may live,Beloved Wife! such solace to impartAs it hath yielded to thy tender heart.RYDAL MOUNT, WESTMORELAND,April , 1815._____________\'Action is transitory--a step, a blow,The motion of a muscle--this way or that--\'Tis done; and in the after-vacancyWe wonder at ourselves like men betrayed:Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,And has the nature of infinity.Yet through that darkness (infinite though it seemAnd irremoveable) gracious openings lie,By which the soul--with patient steps of thoughtNow toiling, waked now on wings of prayer-- May pass in hope, and, though from mortal bondsYet undelivered, rise with sure ascentEven to the fountain-head of peace divine.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDescriptive Sketches Taken During A Pedestrian Tour Among The Alps\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWERE there, below, a spot of holy ground      Where from distress a refuge might be found,      And solitude prepare the soul for heaven;       Sure, nature\'s God that spot to man had given      Where falls the purple morning far and wide      In flakes of light upon the mountain side;       Where with loud voice the power of water shakes      The leafy wood, or sleeps in quiet lakes.        Yet not unrecompensed the man shall roam,      Who at the call of summer quits his home,         And plods through some wide realm o\'er vale and height,      Though seeking only holiday delight;       At least, not owning to himself an aim      To which the sage would give a prouder name.      No gains too cheaply earned his fancy cloy,      Though every passing zephyr whispers joy;       Brisk toil, alternating with ready ease,      Feeds the clear current of his sympathies.      For him sod-seats the cottage-door adorn;       And peeps the far-off spire, his evening bourn!           Dear is the forest frowning o\'er his head,      And dear the velvet green-sward to his tread:      Moves there a cloud o\'er mid-day\'s flaming eye?       Upward he looks- \'and calls it luxury:\'      Kind Nature\'s charities his steps attend;       In every babbling brook he finds a friend;       While chastening thoughts of sweetest use, bestowed      By wisdom, moralise his pensive road.      Host of his welcome inn, the noon-tide bower,      To his spare meal he calls the passing poor;         He views the sun uplift his golden fire,      Or sink, with heart alive like Memnon\'s lyre;       Blesses the moon that comes with kindly ray,      To light him shaken by his rugged way.      Back from his sight no bashful children steal;       He sits a brother at the cottage-meal;       His humble looks no shy restraint impart;       Around him plays at will the virgin heart.      While unsuspended wheels the village dance,      The maidens eye him with enquiring glance,           Much wondering by what fit of crazing care,      Or desperate love, bewildered, he came there.        A hope, that prudence could not then approve,      That clung to Nature with a truant\'s love,      O\'er Gallia\'s wastes of corn my footsteps led;       Her files of road-elms, high above my head      In long-drawn vista, rustling in the breeze;       Or where her pathways straggle as they please      By lonely farms and secret villages.      But lo! the Alps ascending white in air,            Toy with the sun and glitter from afar.        And now, emerging from the forest\'s gloom,      I greet thee, Chartreuse, while I mourn thy doom.      Whither is fled that Power whose frown severe      Awed sober Reason till she crouched in fear?       \'That\' Silence, once in deathlike fetters bound,      Chains that were loosened only by the sound      Of holy rites chanted in measured round?       - The voice of blasphemy the fane alarms,      The cloister startles at the gleam of arms.       The thundering tube the aged angler hears,      Bent o\'er the groaning flood that sweeps away his tears.      Cloud-piercing pine-trees nod their troubled heads,      Spires, rocks, and lawns a browner night o\'erspreads;       Strong terror checks the female peasant\'s sighs,      And start the astonished shades at female eyes.      From Bruno\'s forest screams the affrighted jay,      And slow the insulted eagle wheels away.      A viewless flight of laughing Demons mock      The Cross, by angels planted on the aerial rock.       The \'parting Genius\' sighs with hollow breath      Along the mystic streams of Life and Death.      Swelling the outcry dull, that long resounds      Portentous through her old woods\' trackless bounds,      Vallombre, \'mid her falling fanes, deplores,      For ever broke, the sabbath of her bowers.        More pleased, my foot the hidden margin roves      Of Como, bosomed deep in chestnut groves.      No meadows thrown between, the giddy steeps      Tower, bare or sylvan, from the narrow deeps.         - To towns, whose shades of no rude noise complain,      From ringing team apart and grating wain-       To flat-roofed towns, that touch the water\'s bound,      Or lurk in woody sunless glens profound,      Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,      And o\'er the whitened wave their shadows fling-       The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines;       And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.      The loitering traveller hence, at evening, sees      From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;          Or marks, \'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids      Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;       Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view      Stretch o\'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,      And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,      As up the opposing hills they slowly creep.      Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed      In golden light; half hides itself in shade:      While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,      Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire:       There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw      Rich golden verdure on the lake below.      Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,      And steals into the shade the lazy oar;       Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,      And amorous music on the water dies.      How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets      Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;       Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales      Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales;             Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore,      Each with its household boat beside the door;       Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;       Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows\' nests, on high;       That glimmer hoar in eve\'s last light, descried      Dim from the twilight water\'s shaggy side,      Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods      Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;       Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,      \'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning\'s ray           Slow-travelling down the western hills, to enfold      Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;       Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell      Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,      And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass      Along the steaming lake, to early mass.      But now farewell to each and all- adieu      To every charm, and last and chief to you,      Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade      Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade;            To all that binds the soul in powerless trance,      Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;       Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume      The sylvan cabin\'s lute-enlivened gloom.      - Alas! the very murmur of the streams      Breathes o\'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,      While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell      On joys that might disgrace the captive\'s cell,      Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como\'s marge,      And lures from bay to bay the vocal barge.          Yet are thy softer arts with power indued      To soothe and cheer the poor man\'s solitude.      By silent cottage-doors, the peasant\'s home      Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam.      But once I pierced the mazes of a wood      In which a cabin undeserted stood;       There an old man an olden measure scanned      On a rude viol touched with withered hand.      As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie      Under a hoary oak\'s thin canopy,                    Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,      His children\'s children listened to the sound;       - A Hermit with his family around!         But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles      Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:      Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa\'s stream,      Where, \'mid dim towers and woods, her waters gleam.      From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire      The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire      To where afar rich orange lustres glow               Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:      Or, led where Via Mala\'s chasms confine      The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,      Hang o\'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom      His burning eyes with fearful light illume.        The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go      O\'er life\'s long deserts with its charge of woe,      With sad congratulation joins the train      Where beasts and men together o\'er the plain      Move on- a mighty caravan of pain:                 Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,      Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.      - There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:      Sole human tenant of the piny waste,      By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,      A nursling babe her only comforter;       Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,      A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke!         When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows      Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,              And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad      Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road-       She seeks a covert from the battering shower      In the roofed bridge; a the bridge, ill that dread hour,      Itself all trembling at the torrent\'s power.        Nor is she more at ease on some \'still\' night,      When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;       Only the waning moon hangs dull and red      Above a melancholy mountain\'s head,      Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,              Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;       Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,      Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,      Listens, or quakes while from the forest\'s gulf      Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf.        From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide      Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide;       By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,      Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;       By cells upon whose image, while he prays,              The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;       By many a votive death-cross planted near,      And watered duly with the pious tear,      That faded silent from the upward eye      Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh;       Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves      Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves.        But soon a peopled region on the sight      Opens- a little world of calm delight;       Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,             Spread rooflike o\'er the deep secluded vale,      And beams of evening slipping in between,      Gently illuminate a sober scene:-       Here, on the brown wood-cottages they sleep,      There, over rock or sloping pasture creep.      On as we journey, in clear view displayed,      The still vale lengthens underneath its shade      Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead      The green light sparkles; - the dim bowers recede.      While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,         And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,      In solemn shapes before the admiring eye      Dilated hang the misty pines on high,      Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,      And antique castles seen through gleamy showers.        From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!       To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri\'s lake      In Nature\'s pristine majesty outspread,      Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread:      The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch               Far o\'er the water, hung with groves of beech;       Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,      Nor stop but where creation seems to end.      Yet here and there, if mid the savage scene      Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,      Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep      To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep,      - Before those thresholds (never can they know      The face of traveller passing to and fro,)       No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell                 For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;       Their watch-dog ne\'er his angry bark foregoes,      Touched by the beggar\'s moan of human woes;       The shady porch ne\'er offered a cool seat      To pilgrims overcome by summer\'s heat.      Yet thither the world\'s business finds its way      At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,      And \'there\' are those fond thoughts which Solitude,      However stern, is powerless to exclude.      There doth the maiden watch her lover\'s sail                Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;       At midnight listens till his parting oar,      And its last echo, can be heard no more.        And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons, cry      Amid tempestuous vapours driving by,      Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear      That common growth of earth, the foodful ear;       Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,      And pines the unripened pear in summer\'s kindliest ray;       Contentment shares the desolate domain                     With Independence, child of high Disdain.      Exulting \'mid the winter of the skies,      Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,      And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;       And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds      The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,      And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,      Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste      Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast.        Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour,           All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:      The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:      Dark is the region as with coming night;       But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!       Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,      Glances the wheeling eagle\'s glorious form!       Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine      The wood-crowned cliffs that o\'er the lake recline;       Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold,      At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:            Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun      The \'west\', that burns like one dilated sun,      A crucible of mighty compass, felt      By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt.        But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before      The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;       Confused the Marathonian tale appears,      While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears.      And who, that walks where men of ancient days      Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,              Feels not the spirit of the place control,      Or rouse and agitate his labouring soul?       Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,      Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,      On Zutphen\'s plain; or on that highland dell,      Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell      What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought      Of him whom passion rivets to the spot,      Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe\'s happiest sigh,      And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard\'s eye;                    Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,      And glad Dundee in \'faint huzzas\' expired?         But now with other mind I stand alone      Upon the summit of this naked cone,      And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase      His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space,        Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave      A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,      Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;       Thro\' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;          Where silent Hours their deathlike sway extend,      Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend      Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned      In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,      Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound.      - \'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,      To see a planet\'s pomp and steady light      In the least star of scarce-appearing night;       While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound      Of ether, shining with diminished round,                    And far and wide the icy summits blaze,      Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:      To him the day-star glitters small and bright,      Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,      And he can look beyond the sun, and view      Those fast-receding depths of sable blue      Flying till vision can no more pursue!       - At once bewildering mists around him close,      And cold and hunger are his least of woes;       The Demon of the snow, with angry roar                       Descending, shuts for aye his prison door.      Soon with despair\'s whole weight his spirits sink;       Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;       And, ere his eyes can close upon the day,      The eagle of the Alps o\'ershades her prey.        Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar,      Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;       Or rather stay to taste the mild delights      Of pensive Underwalden\'s pastoral heights.      - Is there who \'mid these awful wilds has seen                 The native Genii walk the mountain green?       Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,      Soft music o\'er the aerial summit steal?       While o\'er the desert, answering every close,      Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.      - And sure there is a secret Power that reigns      Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,      Nought but the \'chalets\', flat and bare, on high      Suspended \'mid the quiet of the sky;       Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,                And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep.      How still! no irreligious sound or sight      Rouses the soul from her severe delight.      An idle voice the sabbath region fills      Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,      And with that voice accords the soothing sound      Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;       Faint wail of eagle melting into blue      Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods\' steady \'sugh\';       The solitary heifer\'s deepened low;                        Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow.      All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,      Blend in a music of tranquillity;       Save when, a stranger seen below, the boy      Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.        When, from the sunny breast of open seas,      And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze      Comes on to gladden April with the sight      Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height;       When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,              And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,      The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,      Leaving to silence the deserted vale;       And like the Patriarchs in their simple age      Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage:      High and more high in summer\'s heat they go,      And hear the rattling thunder far below;       Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,      Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd.        One I behold who, \'cross the foaming flood,              Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;       Another, high on that green ledge; - he gained      The tempting spot with every sinew strained;       And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,      Food for his beasts in time of winter snows.      - Far different life from what Tradition hoar      Transmits of happier lot in times of yore!       Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed      From out the rocks, the wild bees\' safe abode:      Continual waters welling cheered the waste,               And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:      Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,      Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:      Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,      To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare.      Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,      And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,      Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand.      Thus does the father to his children tell      Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well.          Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod      Of angry Nature to avenge her God.      Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts      Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.        \'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows      More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose.      Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,      A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,      A solemn sea! whose billows wide around      Stand motionless, to awful silence bound:              Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,      That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.      A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,      Gapes in the centre of the sea- and, through      That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound      Innumerable streams with roar profound.      Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,      And merry flageolet; the low of herds,      The bark of dogs, the heifer\'s tinkling bell,      Talk, laughter, and perchance a churchtower knell:       Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed      And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised:      Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less      Alive to independent happiness,      Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at eventide      Upon the fragrant mountain\'s purple side:      For as the pleasures of his simple day      Beyond his native valley seldom stray,      Nought round its darling precincts can he find      But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;           While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure\'s urn,      Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return.        Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,      Was blest as free- for he was Nature\'s child.      He, all superior but his God disdained,      Walked none restraining, and by none restrained      Confessed no law but what his reason taught,      Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought.      As man in his primeval dower arrayed      The image of his glorious Sire displayed,                 Even so, by faithful Nature guarded, here      The traces of primeval Man appear;       The simple dignity no forms debase;       The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:      The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,      His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword;       Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared      With this \'the blessings he enjoys to guard.\'        And, as his native hills encircle ground      For many a marvellous victory renowned,                The work of Freedom daring to oppose,      With few in arms, innumerable foes,      When to those famous fields his steps are led,      An unknown power connects him with the dead:      For images of other worlds are there;       Awful the light, and holy is the air.      Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,      Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;       His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain,      Beyond the senses and their little reign.                  And oft, when that dread vision hath past by,      He holds with God himself communion high,      There where the peal of swelling torrents fills      The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;       Or when, upon the mountain\'s silent brow      Reclined, he sees, above him and below,      Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;       While needle peaks of granite shooting bare      Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.      And when a gathering weight of shadows brown             Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;       And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms,      Uplift in quiet their illumined forms,      In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,      Tinged like an angel\'s smile all rosy red-       Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,      And the near heavens impart their own delights.        When downward to his winter hut he goes,      Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;       That hut which on the hills so oft employs               His thoughts, the central point of all his joys.      And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,      Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,      So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends      A little prattling child, he oft descends,      To glance a look upon the well-matched pair;       Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.      There, safely guarded by the woods behind,      He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,      Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,           And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound.        Through Nature\'s vale his homely pleasures glide,      Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;       The bound of all his vanity, to deck,      With one bright bell, a favourite heifer\'s neck;       Well pleased upon some simple annual feast,      Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,      If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,      Of thrice ten summers dignify the board.      - Alas! in every clime a flying ray                        Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;       And here the unwilling mind may more than trace      The general sorrows of the human race;       The churlish gales of penury, that blow      Cold as the north-wind o\'er a waste of snow,      To them the gentle groups of bliss deny      That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.      Yet more; - compelled by Powers which only deign      That \'solitary\' man disturb their reign,      Powers that support an unremitting strife               With all the tender charities of life,      Full oft the father, when his sons have grown      To manhood, seems their title to disown;       And from his nest amid the storms of heaven      Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;       With stern composure watches to the plain-       And never, eagle-like, beholds again!         When long-familiar joys are all resigned,      Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind?       Lo! where through flat Batavia\'s willowy groves,           Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;       O\'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,      And search the affections to their inmost cell;       Sweet poison spreads along the listener\'s veins,      Turning past pleasures into mortal pains;       Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,      Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave.        Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!       Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume!       Fresh gales and dews of life\'s delicious morn,            And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!       Alas! the little joy to man allowed      Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud;       Or like the beauty in a flower installed,      Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.      Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,      And taught that pain is pleasure\'s natural heir,      We still confide in more than we can know;       Death would be else the favourite friend of woe.        \'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,          Between interminable tracts of pine,      Within a temple stands an awful shrine,      By an uncertain light revealed, that falls      On the mute Image and the troubled walls.      Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain      That views, undimmed, Einsiedlen\'s wretched fane.      While ghastly faces through the gloom appear,      Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear;       While prayer contends with silenced agony,      Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.                 If the sad grave of human ignorance bear      One flower of hope- oh, pass and leave it there!         The tall sun, pausing on an Alpine spire,      Flings o\'er the wilderness a stream of fire:      Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day      Close on the remnant of their weary way;       While they are drawing toward the sacred floor      Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more.      How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste      The fountains reared for them amid the waste!           Their thirst they slake:- they wash their toil-worn feet      And some with tears of joy each other greet.      Yes, I must see you when ye first behold      Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,      In that glad moment will for you a sigh      Be heaved, of charitable sympathy;       In that glad moment when your hands are prest      In mute devotion on the thankful breast!         Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields      With rocks and gloomy woods her fertile fields:           Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,      And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend; -       A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns      Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;       Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:      \'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned,      They sport beneath that mountain\'s matchless height      That holds no commerce with the summer night.      From age to age, throughout his lonely bounds      The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;                     Appalling havoc! but serene his brow,      Where daylight lingers on perpetual snow;       Glitter the stars above, and all is black below.        What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,      While roars the sullen Arve in anger by,      That not for thy reward, unrivalled Vale!       Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;       That thou, the slaves of slaves, art doomed to pine      And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,      To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine.             Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,      With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way,      On the bleak sides of Cumbria\'s heath-clad moors,      Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland\'s shores;       To scent the sweets of Piedmont\'s breathing rose,      And orange gale that o\'er Lugano blows;       Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,      That virtue languishes and pleasure fails,      While the remotest hamlets blessings share      In thy loved presence known, and only there;                 \'Heart\'-blessings- outward treasures too which the eye      Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,      And every passing breeze will testify.      There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound      Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound;       The housewife there a brighter garden sees,      Where hum on busier wing her happy bees;       On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;       And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,-       To greet the traveller needing food and rest;            Housed for the night, or but a half-hour\'s guest.        And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees      Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;       Though martial songs have banished songs of love,      And nightingales desert the village grove,      Scared by the fife and rumbling drum\'s alarms,      And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;       That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,      Sole sound, the Sourd prolongs his mournful cry!       - Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power         Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:      All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes      Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies.      Yes, as I roamed where Loiret\'s waters glide      Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,      When from October clouds a milder light      Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;       Methought from every cot the watchful bird      Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;       Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,            Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;       Chasing those pleasant dreams, the falling leaf      Awoke a fainter sense of moral grief;       The measured echo of the distant flail      Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;       With more majestic course the water rolled,      And ripening foliage shone with richer gold.      - But foes are gathering- Liberty must raise      Red on the hills her beacon\'s far-seen blaze;       Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower! -              Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour!       Rejoice, brave Land, though pride\'s perverted ire      Rouse hell\'s own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:      Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;       As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth!       - All cannot be: the promise is too fair      For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:      Yet not for this will sober reason frown      Upon that promise, nor the hope disown;       She knows that only from high aims ensue                     Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due.        Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed      In an impartial balance, give thine aid      To the just cause; and, oh! do thou preside      Over the mighty stream now spreading wide:      So shall its waters, from the heavens supplied      In copious showers, from earth by wholesome springs,      Brood o\'er the long-parched lands with Nile-like wings!       And grant that every sceptred child of clay      Who cries presumptuous, \'Here the flood shall stay,\'                 May in its progress see thy guiding hand,      And cease the acknowledged purpose to withstand;       Or, swept in anger from the insulted shore,      Sink with his servile bands, to rise no more!         To-night, my Friend, within this humble cot      Be scorn and fear and hope alike forgot      In timely sleep; and when, at break of day,      On the tall peaks the glistening sunbeams play,      With a light heart our course we may renew,      The first whose footsteps print the mountain dew.                    1791 & 1792.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Oak Of Guernica Supposed Address To The Same\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOAK of Guernica!

The Tyrians rushing in, an eager band,Their painted couches seek, obedient to command.They look with wonder on the gifts--they gazeUpon Iulus, dazzled with the raysThat from his ardent countenance are flung,And charmed to hear his simulating tongue;Nor pass unpraised the robe and veil divine,Round which the yellow flowers and wandering foliage twine.But chiefly Dido, to the coming illDevoted, strives in vain her vast desires to fill; She views the gifts; upon the child then turnsInsatiable looks, and gazing burns.To ease a father\'s cheated love he hungUpon Aeneas, and around him clung;Then seeks the queen; with her his arts he tries;She fastens on the boy enamoured eyes,Clasps in her arms, nor weens (O lot unblest!)How great a God, incumbent o\'er her breast,Would fill it with his spirit.

News from Mona\'s Isle?Such have we, but unvaried in its style; No tales of Runagates fresh landed, whenceAnd wherefore fugitive or on what pretence;Of feasts, or scandal, eddying like the windMost restlessly alive when most confined.Ask not of me, whose tongue can best appeaseThe mighty tumults of the HOUSE OF KEYS;The last year\'s cup whose Ram or Heifer gained,What slopes are planted, or what mosses drained:An eye of fancy only can I castOn that proud pageant now at hand or past, When full five hundred boats in trim array,With nets and sails outspread and streamers gay,And chanted hymns and stiller voice of prayer,For the old Manx-harvest to the Deep repair,Soon as the herring-shoals at distance shineLike beds of moonlight shifting on the brine.Mona from our Abode is daily seen,But with a wilderness of waves between;And by conjecture only can we speakOf aught transacted there in bay or creek; No tidings reach us thence from town or field,Only faint news her mountain sunbeams yield,And some we gather from the misty air,And some the hovering clouds, our telegraph, declare.But these poetic mysteries I withhold;For Fancy hath her fits both hot and cold,And should the colder fit with You be onWhen You might read, my credit would be gone.Let more substantial themes the pen engage,And nearer interests culled from the opening stage Of our migration.--Ere the welcome dawnHad from the east her silver star withdrawn,The Wain stood ready, at our Cottage-door,Thoughtfully freighted with a various store;And long or ere the uprising of the SunO\'er dew-damped dust our journey was begun,A needful journey, under favouring skies,Through peopled Vales; yet something in the guiseOf those old Patriarchs when from well to wellThey roamed through Wastes where now the tented Arabsdwell. Say first, to whom did we the charge confide,Who promptly undertook the Wain to guideUp many a sharply-twining road and down,And over many a wide hill\'s craggy crown,Through the quick turns of many a hollow nook,And the rough bed of many an unbridged brook?A blooming Lass--who in her better handBore a light switch, her sceptre of commandWhen, yet a slender Girl, she often led,Skilful and bold, the horse and burthened sled From the peat-yielding Moss on Gowdar\'s head.What could go wrong with such a CharioteerFor goods and chattels, or those Infants dear,A Pair who smilingly sate side by side,Our hope confirming that the salt-sea tideWhose free embraces we were bound to seek,Would their lost strength restore and freshen the pale cheek?Such hope did either Parent entertainPacing behind along the silent lane.Blithe hopes and happy musings soon took flight, For lo! an uncouth melancholy sight--On a green bank a creature stood forlornJust half protruded to the light of morn,Its hinder part concealed by hedge-row thornThe Figure called to mind a beast of preyStript of its frightful powers by slow decay,And, though no longer upon rapine bent,Dim memory keeping of its old intent.We started, looked again with anxious eyes,And in that griesly object recognise The Curate\'s Dog--his long-tried friend, for they,As well we knew, together had grown grey.The Master died, his drooping servant\'s griefFound at the Widow\'s feet some sad relief;Yet still he lived in pining discontent,Sadness which no indulgence could prevent;Hence whole day wanderings, broken nightly sleepsAnd lonesome watch that out of doors he keeps;Not oftentimes, I trust, as we, poor brute!Espied him on his legs sustained, blank, mute, And of all visible motion destitute,So that the very heaving of his breathSeemed stopt, though by some other power than death.Long as we gazed upon the form and face,A mild domestic pity kept its place,Unscared by thronging fancies of strange hueThat haunted us in spite of what we knew.Even now I sometimes think of him as lostIn second-sight appearances, or crostBy spectral shapes of guilt, or to the ground, On which he stood, by spells unnatural bound,Like a gaunt shaggy Porter forced to waitIn days of old romance at Archimago\'s gate.Advancing Summer, Nature\'s law fulfilled,The choristers in every grove had stilled;But we, we lacked not music of our own,For lightsome Fanny had thus early thrown,Mid the gay prattle of those infant tongues,Some notes prelusive, from the round of songsWith which, more zealous than the liveliest bird That in wild Arden\'s brakes was ever heard,Her work and her work\'s partners she can cheer,The whole day long, and all days of the year.Thus gladdened from our own dear Vale we passAnd soon approach Diana\'s Looking-glass!To Loughrigg-tarn, round clear and bright as heaven,Such name Italian fancy would have given,Ere on its banks the few grey cabins roseThat yet disturb not its concealed reposeMore than the feeblest wind that idly blows. Ah, Beaumont! when an opening in the roadStopped me at once by charm of what it showed,The encircling region vividly exprestWithin the mirror\'s depth, a world at rest--Sky streaked with purple, grove and craggy bield,And the smooth green of many a pendent field,And, quieted and soothed, a torrent small,A little daring would-be waterfall,One chimney smoking and its azure wreath,Associate all in the calm Pool beneath, With here and there a faint imperfect gleamOf water-lilies veiled in misty steam--What wonder at this hour of stillness deep,A shadowy link \'tween wakefulness and sleep,When Nature\'s self, amid such blending, seemsTo render visible her own soft dreams,If, mixed with what appeared of rock, lawn, wood,Fondly embosomed in the tranquil flood,A glimpse I caught of that Abode, by TheeDesigned to rise in humble privacy, A lowly Dwelling, here to be outspread,Like a small Hamlet, with its bashful headHalf hid in native trees. Alas \'tis not,Nor ever was; I sighed, and left the spotUnconscious of its own untoward lot,And thought in silence, with regret too keen,Of unexperienced joys that might have been;Of neighbourhood and intermingling arts,And golden summer days uniting cheerful hearts.But time, irrevocable time, is flown. And let us utter thanks for blessings sownAnd reaped--what hath been, and what is, our own.Not far we travelled ere a shout of glee,Startling us all, dispersed my reverie;Such shout as many a sportive echo meetingOft-times from Alpine \'chalets\' sends a greeting.Whence the blithe hail? behold a Peasant standOn high, a kerchief waving in her hand!Not unexpectant that by early dayOur little Band would thrid this mountain way, Before her cottage on the bright hill sideShe hath advanced with hope to be descried.Right gladly answering signals we displayed,Moving along a tract of morning shade,And vocal wishes sent of like good willTo our kind Friend high on the sunny hill--Luminous region, fair as if the primeWere tempting all astir to look aloft or climb;Only the centre of the shining cotWith door left open makes a gloomy spot, Emblem of those dark corners sometimes foundWithin the happiest breast on earthly ground.Rich prospect left behind of stream and vale,And mountain-tops, a barren ridge we scale;Descend, and reach, in Yewdale\'s depths, a plainWith haycocks studded, striped with yellowing grain--An area level as a Lake and spreadUnder a rock too steep for man to tread,Where sheltered from the north and bleak northwestAloft the Raven hangs a visible nest, Fearless of all assaults that would her brood molest.Hot sunbeams fill the steaming vale; but hark,At our approach, a jealous watch-dog\'s bark,Noise that brings forth no liveried Page of state,But the whole household, that our coming wait.With Young and Old warm greetings we exchange,And jocund smiles, and toward the lowly GrangePress forward by the teasing dogs unscared.Entering, we find the morning meal prepared:So down we sit, though not till each had cast Pleased looks around the delicate repast--Rich cream, and snow-white eggs fresh from the nest,With amber honey from the mountain\'s breast;Strawberries from lane or woodland, offering wildOf children\'s industry, in hillocks piled;Cakes for the nonce, and butter fit to lieUpon a lordly dish; frank hospitalityWhere simple art with bounteous nature vied,And cottage comfort shuned not seemly pride.Kind Hostess! Handmaid also of the feast, If thou be lovelier than the kindling East,Words by thy presence unrestrained may speakOf a perpetual dawn from brow and cheekInstinct with light whose sweetest promise lies,Never retiring, in thy large dark eyes,Dark but to every gentle feeling true,As if their lustre flowed from ether\'s purest blue.Let me not ask what tears may have been weptBy those bright eyes, what weary vigils kept,Beside that hearth what sighs may have been heaved For wounds inflicted, nor what toil relievedBy fortitude and patience, and the graceOf heaven in pity visiting the place.Not unadvisedly those secret springsI leave unsearched: enough that memory clings,Here as elsewhere, to notices that makeTheir own significance for hearts awake,To rural incidents, whose genial powersFilled with delight three summer morning hours.More cold my pen report of grave or gay That through our gipsy travel cheered the way;But, bursting forth above the waves, the SunLaughs at my pains, and seems to say, \'Be done.\'Yet, Beaumont, thou wilt not, I trust, reproveThis humble offering made by Truth to Love,Nor chide the Muse that stooped to break a spellWhich might have else been on me yet:--FAREWELL.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Martial Courage Of A Day Is Vain\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE martial courage of a day is vain,An empty noise of death the battle\'s roar,If vital hope be wanting to restore,Or fortitude be wanting to sustain,Armies or kingdoms.

And her Tyrolean Champion we beholdMurdered, like one ashore by shipwreck cast,Murdered without relief.

January 18, 1816\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIHAIL, orient Conqueror of gloomy Night!Thou that canst shed the bliss of gratitudeOn hearts howe\'er insensible or rude;Whether thy punctual visitations smiteThe haughty towers where monarchs dwell;Or thou, impartial Sun, with presence brightCheer\'st the low threshold of the peasant\'s cell!Not unrejoiced I see thee climb the skyIn naked splendour, clear from mist or haze,Or cloud approaching to divert the rays,Which even in deepest winter testifyThy power and majesty,Dazzling the vision that presumes to gaze.--Well does thine aspect usher in this Day;As aptly suits therewith that modest paceSubmitted to the chainsThat bind thee to the path which God ordainsThat thou shalt trace,Till, with the heavens and earth, thou pass away!Nor less, the stillness of these frosty plains,Their utter stillness, and the silent graceOf yon ethereal summits white with snow,(Whose tranquil pomp and spotless purityReport of storms gone byTo us who tread below)Do with the service of this Day accord.--Divinest Object which the uplifted eyeOf mortal man is suffered to behold;Thou, who upon those snow-clad Heights has pouredMeek lustre, nor forget\'st the humble Vale;Thou who dost warm Earth\'s universal mould,And for thy bounty wert not unadoredBy pious men of old;Once more, heart-cheering Sun, I bid thee hail!Bright be thy course to-day, let not this promise fail!II\'Mid the deep quiet of this morning hour,All nature seems to hear me while I speak,By feelings urged that do not vainly seekApt language, ready as the tuneful notesThat stream in blithe succession from the throatsOf birds, in leafy bower,Warbling a farewell to a vernal shower.--There is a radiant though a short-lived flame,That burns for Poets in the dawning east;And oft my soul hath kindled at the same,When the captivity of sleep had ceased;But He who fixed immoveably the frameOf the round world, and built, by laws as strong,A solid refuge for distress--The towers of righteousness;He knows that from a holier altar cameThe quickening spark of this day\'s sacrifice;Knows that the source is nobler whence doth riseThe current of this matin song;That deeper far it liesThan aught dependent on the fickle skies.IIIHave we not conquered?--by the vengeful sword?Ah no, by dint of Magnanimity;That curbed the baser passions, and left freeA loyal band to follow their liege LordClear-sighted Honour, and his staid Compeers,Along a track of most unnatural years;In execution of heroic deedsWhose memory, spotless as the crystal beadsOf morning dew upon the untrodden meads,Shall live enrolled above the starry spheres.He, who in concert with an earthly stringOf Britain\'s acts would sing,He with enraptured voice will tellOf One whose spirit no reverse could quell;Of One that \'mid the failing never failed--Who paints how Britain struggled and prevailedShall represent her labouring with an eyeOf circumspect humanity;Shall show her clothed with strength and skill,All martial duties to fulfil;Firm as a rock in stationary fight;In motion rapid as the lightning\'s gleam;Fierce as a flood-gate bursting at midnightTo rouse the wicked from their giddy dream--Woe, woe to all that face her in the field!Appalled she may not be, and cannot yield.IVAnd thus is \'missed\' the sole true gloryThat can belong to human story!At which they only shall arriveWho through the abyss of weakness dive.The very humblest are too proud of heart;And one brief day is rightly set apartFor Him who lifteth up and layeth low;For that Almighty God to whom we owe,Say not that we have vanquished--but that we survive.VHow dreadful the dominion of the impure!Why should the Song be tardy to proclaimThat less than power unbounded could not tameThat soul of Evil--which, from hell let loose,Had filled the astonished world with such abuseAs boundless patience only could endure?--Wide-wasted regions--cities wrapt in flame--Who sees, may lift a streaming eyeTo Heaven;--who never saw, may heave a sigh;But the foundation of our nature shakes,And with an infinite pain the spirit aches,When desolated countries, towns on fire,Are but the avowed attireOf warfare waged with desperate mindAgainst the life of virtue in mankind;Assaulting without ruthThe citadels of truth;While the fair gardens of civility,By ignorance defaced,By violence laid waste,Perish without reprieve for flower or tree!VIA crouching purpose--a distracted will--Opposed to hopes that battened upon scorn,And to desires whose ever-waxing hornNot all the light of earthly power could fill;Opposed to dark, deep plots of patient skill,And to celerities of lawless force;Which, spurning God, had flung away remorse--What could they gain but shadows of redress?--So bad proceeded propagating worse;And discipline was passion\'s dire excess.Widens the fatal web, its lines extend,And deadlier poisons in the chalice blend.When will your trials teach you to be wise?--O prostrate Lands, consult your agonies!VIINo more--the guilt is banished,And, with the guilt, the shame is fled;And, with the guilt and shame, the Woe hath vanished,Shaking the dust and ashes from her head!--No more--these lingerings of distressSully the limpid stream of thankfulness.What robe can Gratitude employSo seemly as the radiant vest of Joy?What steps so suitable as those that moveIn prompt obedience to spontaneous measuresOf glory, and felicity, and love,Surrendering the whole heart to sacred pleasures?VIIIO Britain! dearer far than life is dear,If one there beOf all thy progenyWho can forget thy prowess, never moreBe that ungrateful Son allowed to hearThy green leaves rustle or thy torrents roar.As springs the lion from his den,As from a forest-brakeUpstarts a glistering snake,The bold Arch-despot re-appeared;--againWide Europe heaves, impatient to be cast,With all her armed Powers,On that offensive soil, like waves upon a thousand shores.The trumpet blew a universal blast!But Thou art foremost in the field:--there stand:Receive the triumph destined to thy hand!All States have glorified themselves;--their claimsAre weighed by Providence, in balance even;And now, in preference to the mightiest names,To Thee the exterminating sword is given.Dread mark of approbation, justly gained!Exalted office, worthily sustained!IXPreserve, O Lord! within our heartsThe memory of thy favour,That else insensibly departs,And loses its sweet savour!Lodge it within us!--as the power of lightLives inexhaustibly in precious gems,Fixed on the front of Eastern diadems,So shine our thankfulness for ever bright!What offering, what transcendent monumentShall our sincerity to Thee present?--Not work of hands; but trophies that may reachTo highest Heaven--the labour of the Soul;That builds, as thy unerring precepts teach,Upon the internal conquests made by each,Her hope of lasting glory for the whole.Yet will not heaven disown nor earth gainsayThe outward service of this day;Whether the worshippers entreatForgiveness from God\'s mercy-seat;Or thanks and praises to His throne ascendThat He has brought our warfare to an end,And that we need no second victory!--Ha! what a ghastly sight for man to see;And to the heavenly saints in peace who dwell,For a brief moment, terrible;But, to thy sovereign penetration, fair,Before whom all things are, that were,All judgments that have been, or e\'er shall be;Links in the chain of thy tranquillity!Along the bosom of this favoured Nation,Breathe Thou, this day, a vital undulation!Let all who do this land inheritBe conscious of thy moving spirit!Oh, \'tis a goodly Ordinance,--the sight,Though sprung from bleeding war, is one of pure delight;Bless Thou the hour, or ere the hour arrive,When a whole people shall kneel down in prayer,And, at one moment, in one rapture, striveWith lip and heart to tell their gratitudeFor thy protecting care,Their solemn joy--praising the Eternal LordFor tyranny subdued,And for the sway of equity renewed,For liberty confirmed, and peace restored!XBut hark--the summons!--down the placid lakeFloats the soft cadence of the church-tower bells;Bright shines the Sun, as if his beams would wakeThe tender insects sleeping in their cells;Bright shines the Sun--and not a breeze to shakeThe drops that tip the melting icicles.\'O, enter now his temple gate!\'Inviting words--perchance already flung(As the crowd press devoutly down the aisleOf some old Minster\'s venerable pile)From voices into zealous passion stung,While the tubed engine feels the inspiring blast,And has begun--its clouds of sound to castForth towards empyreal Heaven,As if the fretted roof were riven.\'Us\', humbler ceremonies now await;But in the bosom, with devout respectThe banner of our joy we will erect,And strength of love our souls shall elevate:For to a few collected in his name,Their heavenly Father will incline an earGracious to service hallowed by its aim;--Awake! the majesty of God revere!Go--and with foreheads meekly bowedPresent your prayers--go--and rejoice aloud--The Holy One will hear!And what, \'mid silence deep, with faith sincere,Ye, in

voice; it said, \'Drink, pretty creature, drink!\'And, looking o\'er the hedge, before me I espiedA snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side.Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone,And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone;With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel,While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal.The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took,Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook. \'Drink, pretty creature, drink,\' she said in such a toneThat I almost received her heart into my own.\'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare!I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair.Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away:But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay.Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady placeI unobserved could see the workings of her face:If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring,Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing: \'What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord?Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board?Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be;Rest, little young One, rest; what is\'t that aileth thee?\'What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart?Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art:This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers;And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears!\'If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain,This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain; For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need\'st not fear,The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here.\'Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the dayWhen my father found thee first in places far away;Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none,And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone.\'He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home:A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam?A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yeanUpon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been. \'Thou know\'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this canFresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran;And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew,I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new.\'Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now,Then I\'ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough;My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is coldOur hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold.\'It will not, will not rest!--Poor creature, can it beThat \'tis thy mother\'s heart which is working so in thee?

his boat and twinkling oar.My father was a good and pious man,An honest man, by honest parents bred,And I believe that, soon as I beganTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,And in his hearing there my prayers I said:And afterwards, by my good father taught,I read, and loved the books in which I read;For books in every neighboring house I sought,And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.Can I forget what charms did once adornMy garden, stored with pease, and mint, and thyme,And rose and lily for the sabbath morn?The sabbath bells, and the delightful chime;The gambols and wild freaks at shearing time;My hen\'s rich nest through long grass scarce espied;The cowslip-gathering at May\'s dewy prime;The swans, that when I sought the water-side,From far to meet me came, spreading their snowy pride.The staff I yet remember which upboreThe bending body of my active sire;His seat beneath the honeyed sycamoreWhen the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;When market-morning came, the neat attireWith which, though bent on haste, myself I deck\'d;My watchful dog, whose starts of furious ire,When stranger passed, so often I have check\'d;The red-breast known for years, which at my casement peck\'d.The suns of twenty summers danced along, -Ah! little marked, how fast they rolled away:Then rose a mansion proud our woods among,And cottage after cottage owned its sway,No joy to see a neighboring house, or strayThrough pastures not his own, the master took;My Father dared his greedy wish gainsay;He loved his old hereditary nook,And ill could I the thought of such sad parting brook.But, when he had refused the proffered gold,To cruel injuries he became a prey,Sore traversed in whate\'er he bought and sold:His troubles grew upon him day by day,Till all his substance fell into decay.His little range of water was denied;All but the bed where his old body lay,All, all was seized, and weeping, side by side,We sought a home where we uninjured might abide.Can I forget that miserable hour,When from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,Peering above the trees, the steeple tower,That on his marriage-day sweet music made?Till then he hoped his bones might there be laid,Close by my mother in their native bowers:Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed, \\\'f3 I could not pray: \\\'f3 through tears that fell in showers,Glimmer\'d our dear-loved home, alas!

Then peace to cruelty and scorn,While to the prison they are borne,Peace, peace to all indignity!\'And so in Prison were they laid--Oh hear me, hear me, gentle Maid,For I am come with power to bless,By scattering gleams, through your distress,Of a redeeming happiness.Me did a reverent pity moveAnd privilege of ancient love; And, in your service, making bold,Entrance I gained to that stronghold.Your Father gave me cordial greeting;But to his purposes, that burnedWithin him, instantly returned:He was commanding and entreating,And said--\'We need not stop, my Son!Thoughts press, and time is hurrying on\'--And so to Francis he renewedHis words, more calmly thus pursued. \'Might this our enterprise have sped,Change wide and deep the Land had seen,A renovation from the dead,A spring-tide of immortal green:The darksome altars would have blazedLike stars when clouds are rolled away;Salvation to all eyes that gazed,Once more the Rood had been upraisedTo spread its arms, and stand for aye.Then, then--had I survived to see New life in Bolton Priory;The voice restored, the eye of TruthRe-opened that inspired my youth;To see her in her pomp arrayed--This Banner (for such vow I made)Should on the consecrated breastOf that same Temple have found rest:I would myself have hung it high,Fit offering of glad victory!A shadow of such thought remains To cheer this sad and pensive time;A solemn fancy yet sustainsOne feeble Being--bids me climbEven to the last--one effort moreTo attest my Faith, if not restore.Hear then,\' said he, \'while I impart,My Son, the last wish of my heart.The Banner strive thou to regain;And, if the endeavour prove not vain,Bear it--to whom if not to thee Shall I this lonely thought consign?--Bear it to Bolton Priory,And lay it on Saint Mary\'s shrine;To wither in the sun and breeze\'Mid those decaying sanctities.There let at least the gift be laid,The testimony there displayed;Bold proof that with no selfish aim,But for lost Faith and Christ\'s dear name,I helmeted a brow though white, And took a place in all men\'s sight;Yea offered up this noble Brood,This fair unrivalled Brotherhood,And turned away from thee, my Son!And left--but be the rest unsaid,The name untouched, the tear unshed;--My wish is known, and I have done:Now promise, grant this one request,This dying prayer, and be thou blest!\'Then Francis answered--\'Trust thy Son, For, with God\'s will, it shall be done!\'--The pledge obtained, the solemn wordThus scarcely given, a noise was heard,And Officers appeared in stateTo lead the prisoners to their fate.They rose, oh! wherefore should I fearTo tell, or, Lady, you to hear?They rose--embraces none were given--They stood like trees when earth and heavenAre calm; they knew each other\'s worth, And reverently the Band went forth.They met, when they had reached the door,One with profane and harsh intentPlaced there--that he might go beforeAnd, with that rueful Banner borneAloft in sign of taunting scorn,Conduct them to their punishment:So cruel Sussex, unrestrainedBy human feeling, had ordained.The unhappy Banner Francis saw, And, with a look of calm commandInspiring universal awe,He took it from the soldier\'s hand;And all the people that stood roundConfirmed the deed in peace profound.--High transport did the Father shedUpon his Son--and they were led,Led on, and yielded up their breath;Together died, a happy death!--But Francis, soon as he had braved That insult, and the Banner saved,Athwart the unresisting tideOf the spectators occupiedIn admiration or dismay,Bore instantly his Charge away.\'These things, which thus had in the sightAnd hearing passed of Him who stoodWith Emily, on the Watch-tower height,In Rylstone\'s woeful neighbourhood,He told; and oftentimes with voice Of power to comfort or rejoice;For deepest sorrows that aspire,Go high, no transport ever higher.\'Yes--God is rich in mercy,\' saidThe old Man to the silent Maid,\'Yet, Lady! shines, through this black night,One star of aspect heavenly bright;Your Brother lives--he lives--is comePerhaps already to his home;Then let us leave this dreary place.\' She yielded, and with gentle pace,Though without one uplifted look,To Rylstone-hall her way she took.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM Bolton\'s old monastic towerThe bells ring loud with gladsome power;The sun shines bright; the fields are gayWith people in their best arrayOf stole and doublet, hood and scarf,Along the banks of crystal Wharf,Through the Vale retired and lowly,Trooping to that summons holy.And, up among the moorlands, seeWhat sprinklings of blithe company! Of lasses and of shepherd grooms,That down the steep hills force their way,Like cattle through the budded brooms;Path, or no path, what care they?And thus in joyous mood they hieTo Bolton\'s mouldering Priory.What would they there?--Full fifty yearsThat sumptuous Pile, with all its peers,Too harshly hath been doomed to tasteThe bitterness of wrong and waste: Its courts are ravaged; but the towerIs standing with a voice of power,That ancient voice which wont to callTo mass or some high festival;And in the shattered fabric\'s heartRemaineth one protected part;A Chapel, like a wild-bird\'s nest,Closely embowered and trimly drest;And thither young and old repair,This Sabbath-day, for praise and prayer. Fast the churchyard fills;--anonLook again, and they all are gone;The cluster round the porch, and the folkWho sate in the shade of the Prior\'s Oak!And scarcely have they disappearedEre the prelusive hymn is heard:--With one consent the people rejoice,Filling the church with a lofty voice!They sing a service which they feel:For \'tis the sunrise now of zeal; Of a pure faith the vernal prime--In great Eliza\'s golden time.A moment ends the fervent din,And all is hushed, without and within;For though the priest, more tranquilly,Recites the holy liturgy,The only voice which you can hearIs the river murmuring near.--When soft!--the dusky trees between,And down the path through the open green, Where is no living thing to be seen;And through yon gateway, where is found,Beneath the arch with ivy bound,Free entrance to the churchyard ground--Comes gliding in with lovely gleam,Comes gliding in serene and slow,Soft and silent as a dream,A solitary Doe!White she is as lily of June,And beauteous as the silver moon When out of sight the clouds are drivenAnd she is left alone in heaven;Or like a ship some gentle dayIn sunshine sailing far away,A glittering ship, that hath the plainOf ocean for her own domain.Lie silent in your graves, ye dead!Lie quiet in your churchyard bed!Ye living, tend your holy cares;Ye multitude, pursue your prayers; And blame not me if my heart and sightAre occupied with one delight!\'Tis a work for sabbath hoursIf I with this bright Creature go:Whether she be of forest bowers,From the bowers of earth below;Or a Spirit for one day given,A pledge of grace from purest heaven.What harmonious pensive changesWait upon her as she ranges Round and through this Pile of stateOverthrown and desolate!Now a step or two her wayLeads through space of open day,Where the enamoured sunny lightBrightens her that was so bright;Now doth a delicate shadow fall,Falls upon her like a breath,From some lofty arch or wall,As she passes underneath: Now some gloomy nook partakesOf the glory that she makes,--High-ribbed vault of stone, or cell,With perfect cunning framed as wellOf stone, and ivy, and the spreadOf the elder\'s bushy head;Some jealous and forbidding cell,That doth the living stars repel,And where no flower hath leave to dwell.The presence of this wandering Doe Fills many a damp obscure recessWith lustre of a saintly show;And, reappearing, she no lessSheds on the flowers that round her blowA more than sunny liveliness.But say, among these holy places,Which thus assiduously she paces,Comes she with a votary\'s task,Rite to perform, or boon to ask?Fair Pilgrim! harbours she a sense Of sorrow, or of reverence?Can she be grieved for quire or shrine,Crushed as if by wrath divine?For what survives of house where GodWas worshipped, or where Man abode;For old magnificence undone;Or for the gentler work begunBy Nature, softening and concealing,And busy with a hand of healing?Mourns she for lordly chamber\'s hearth That to the sapling ash gives birth;For dormitory\'s length laid bareWhere the wild rose blossoms fair;Or altar, whence the cross was rent,Now rich with mossy ornament?--She sees a warrior carved in stone,Among the thick weeds, stretched alone;A warrior, with his shield of prideCleaving humbly to his side,And hands in resignation prest, Palm to palm, on his tranquil breast;As little she regards the sightAs a common creature might:If she be doomed to inward care,Or service, it must lie elsewhere.--But hers are eyes serenely bright,And on she moves--with pace how light!Nor spares to stoop her head, and tasteThe dewy turf with flowers bestrown;And thus she fares, until at last Beside the ridge of a grassy graveIn quietness she lays her down;Gentle as a weary waveSinks, when the summer breeze hath died,Against an anchored vessel\'s side;Even so, without distress, doth sheLie down in peace, and lovingly.The day is placid in its going,To a lingering motion bound,Like the crystal stream now flowing With its softest summer sound:So the balmy minutes pass,While this radiant Creature liesCouched upon the dewy grass,Pensively with downcast eyes.--But now again the people raiseWith awful cheer a voice of praise;It is the last, the parting song;And from the temple forth they throng,And quickly spread themselves abroad, While each pursues his several road.But some--a variegated bandOf middle-aged, and old, and young,And little children by the handUpon their leading mothers hung--With mute obeisance gladly paidTurn towards the spot, where, full in view,The white Doe, to her service true,Her sabbath couch has made.It was a solitary mound; Which two spears\' length of level groundDid from all other graves divide:As if in some respect of pride;Or melancholy\'s sickly mood,Still shy of human neighbourhood;Or guilt, that humbly would expressA penitential loneliness.\'Look, there she is, my Child! draw near;She fears not, wherefore should we fear?She means no harm;\'--but still the Boy, To whom the words were softly said,Hung back, and smiled, and blushed for joy,A shame-faced blush of glowing red!Again the Mother whispered low,\'Now you have seen the famous Doe;From Rylstone she hath found her wayOver the hills this sabbath dayHer work, whate\'er it be, is done,And she will depart when we are gone;Thus doth she keep, from year to year, Her sabbath morning, foul or fair.\'Bright was the Creature, as in dreamsThe Boy had seen her, yea, more bright;But is she truly what she seems?He asks with insecure delight,Asks of himself, and doubts,--and stillThe doubt returns against his will:Though he, and all the standers-by,Could tell a tragic historyOf facts divulged, wherein appear Substantial motive, reason clear,Why thus the milk-white Doe is foundCouchant beside that lonely mound;And why she duly loves to paceThe circuit of this hallowed place.Nor to the Child\'s inquiring mindIs such perplexity confined:For, spite of sober Truth that seesA world of fixed remembrancesWhich to this mystery belong, If, undeceived, my skill can traceThe characters of every face,There lack not strange delusion here,Conjecture vague, and idle fear,And superstitious fancies strong,Which do the gentle Creature wrong.That bearded, staff-supported Sire--Who in his boyhood often fedFull cheerily on convent-breadAnd heard old tales by the convent-fire, And to his grave will go with scars,Relics of long and distant wars--That Old Man, studious to expoundThe spectacle, is mounting highTo days of dim antiquity;When Lady Aaliza mournedHer Son, and felt in her despairThe pang of unavailing prayer;Her Son in Wharf\'s abysses drowned,The noble Boy of Egremound. From which affliction--when the graceOf God had in her heart found place--A pious structure, fair to seeRose up, this stately Priory!The Lady\'s work;--but now laid low;To the grief of her soul that doth come and go,In the beautiful form of this innocent Doe:Which, though seemingly doomed in its breast to sustainA softened remembrance of sorrow and pain,Is spotless, and holy, and gentle, and bright; And glides o\'er the earth like an angel of light.Pass, pass who will, yon chantry door;And, through the chink in the fractured floorLook down, and see a griesly sight;A vault where the bodies are buried upright!There, face by face, and hand by hand,The Claphams and Mauleverers stand;And, in his place, among son and sire,Is John de Clapham, that fierce Esquire,A valiant man, and a name of dread In the ruthless wars of the White and Red;Who dragged Earl Pembroke from Banbury churchAnd smote off his head on the stones of the porch!Look down among them, if you dare;Oft does the White Doe loiter there,Prying into the darksome rent;Nor can it be with good intent:So thinks that Dame of haughty air,Who hath a Page her book to hold,And wears a frontlet edged with gold. Harsh thoughts with her high mood agree--Who counts among her ancestryEarl Pembroke, slain so impiously!That slender Youth, a scholar pale,From Oxford come to his native vale,He also hath his own conceit:It is, thinks he, the gracious Fairy,Who loved the Shepherd-lord to meetIn his wanderings solitary:Wild notes she in his hearing sang, A song of Nature\'s hidden powers;That whistled like the wind, and rangAmong the rocks and holly bowers.\'Twas said that She all shapes could wear;And oftentimes before him stood,Amid the trees of some thick wood,In semblance of a lady fair;And taught him signs, and showed him sights,In Craven\'s dens, on Cumbrian heights;When under cloud of fear he lay, A shepherd clad in homely grey;Nor left him at his later day.And hence, when he, with spear and shield,Rode full of years to Flodden-field,His eye could see the hidden spring,And how the current was to flow;The fatal end of Scotland\'s King,And all that hopeless overthrow.But not in wars did he delight,\'This\' Clifford wished for worthier might; Nor in broad pomp, or courtly state;Him his own thoughts did elevate,--Most happy in the shy recessOf Barden\'s lowly quietness.And choice of studious friends had heOf Bolton\'s dear fraternity;Who, standing on this old church tower,In many a calm propitious hour,Perused, with him, the starry sky;Or, in their cells, with him did pry For other lore,--by keen desireUrged to close toil with chemic fire;In quest belike of transmutationsRich as the mine\'s most bright creations.But they and their good works are fled,And all is now disquieted--And peace is none, for living or dead!Ah, pensive Scholar, think not so,But look again at the radiant Doe!What quiet watch she seems to keep, Alone, beside that grassy heap!Why mention other thoughts unmeetFor vision so composed and sweet?While stand the people in a ring,Gazing, doubting, questioning;Yea, many overcome in spiteOf recollections clear and bright;Which yet do unto some impartAn undisturbed repose of heart.And all the assembly own a law Of orderly respect and awe;But see--they vanish one by one,And last, the Doe herself is gone.Harp! we have been full long beguiledBy vague thoughts, lured by fancies wild;To which, with no reluctant strings,Thou hast attuned thy murmurings;And now before this Pile we standIn solitude, and utter peace:But, Harp! thy murmurs may not cease-- A Spirit, with his angelic wings,In soft and breeze-like visitings,Has touched thee--and a Spirit\'s hand:A voice is with us--a commandTo chant, in strains of heavenly glory,A tale of tears, a mortal story!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe White Doe Of Rylstone, Or, The Fate Of The Nortons  -  Canto Seventh\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Powers there areThat touch each other to the quick--in modesWhich the gross world no sense hath to perceive,No soul to dream of.\'THOU Spirit, whose angelic handWas to the harp a strong command,Called the submissive strings to wakeIn glory for this Maiden\'s sake,Say, Spirit! whither hath she fledTo hide her poor afflicted head?What mighty forest in its gloomEnfolds her?--is a rifted tombWithin the wilderness her seat?Some island which the wild waves beat-- Is that the Sufferer\'s last retreat?Or some aspiring rock, that shroudsIts perilous front in mists and clouds?High-climbing rock, low sunless dale,Sea, desert, what do these avail?Oh take her anguish and her fearsInto a deep recess of years!\'Tis done;--despoil and desolationO\'er Rylstone\'s fair domain have blown;Pools, terraces, and walks are sown With weeds; the bowers are overthrown,Or have given way to slow mutation,While, in their ancient habitationThe Norton name hath been unknown.The lordly Mansion of its prideIs stripped; the ravage hath spread wideThrough park and field, a perishingThat mocks the gladness of the Spring!And, with this silent gloom agreeing,Appears a joyless human Being, Of aspect such as if the wasteWere under her dominion placed.Upon a primrose bank, her throneOf quietness, she sits alone;Among the ruins of a wood,Erewhile a covert bright and green,And where full many a brave tree stood,That used to spread its boughs, and ringWith the sweet bird\'s carolling.Behold her, like a virgin Queen, Neglecting in imperial stateThese outward images of fate,And carrying inward a sereneAnd perfect sway, through many a thoughtOf chance and change, that hath been broughtTo the subjection of a holy,Though stern and rigorous, melancholy!The like authority, with graceOf awfulness, is in her face,--There hath she fixed it; yet it seems To o\'ershadow by no native rightThat face, which cannot lose the gleams,Lose utterly the tender gleams,Of gentleness and meek delight,And loving-kindness ever bright:Such is her sovereign mien:--her dress(A vest with woollen cincture tied,A hood of mountain-wool undyed)Is homely,--fashioned to expressA wandering Pilgrim\'s humbleness. And she \'hath\' wandered, long and far,Beneath the light of sun and star;Hath roamed in trouble and in grief,Driven forward like a withered leaf,Yea like a ship at random blownTo distant places and unknown.But now she dares to seek a havenAmong her native wilds of Craven;Hath seen again her Father\'s roof,And put her fortitude to proof; The mighty sorrow hath been borne,And she is thoroughly forlorn:Her soul doth in itself stand fast,Sustained by memory of the pastAnd strength of Reason; held aboveThe infirmities of mortal love;Undaunted, lofty, calm, and stable,And awfully impenetrable.And so--beneath a mouldered tree,A self-surviving leafless oak By unregarded age from strokeOf ravage saved--sate Emily.There did she rest, with head reclined,Herself most like a stately flower,(Such have I seen) whom chance of birthHath separated from its kind,To live and die in a shady bower,Single on the gladsome earth.When, with a noise like distant thunder,A troop of deer came sweeping by; And, suddenly, behold a wonder!For One, among those rushing deer,A single One, in mid careerHath stopped, and fixed her large full eyeUpon the Lady Emily;A Doe most beautiful, clear-white,A radiant creature, silver-bright!Thus checked, a little while it stayed;A little thoughtful pause it made;And then advanced with stealth-like pace, Drew softly near her, and more near--Looked round--but saw no cause for fear;So to her feet the Creature came,And laid its head upon her knee,And looked into the Lady\'s face,A look of pure benignity,And fond unclouded memory.It is, thought Emily, the same,The very Doe of other years!--The pleading look the Lady viewed, And, by her gushing thoughts subdued,She melted into tears--A flood of tears, that flowed apace,Upon the happy Creature\'s face.Oh, moment ever blest! O PairBeloved of Heaven, Heaven\'s chosen care,This was for you a precious greeting;And may it prove a fruitful meeting!Joined are they, and the sylvan DoeCan she depart? can she forego The Lady, once her playful peer,And now her sainted Mistress dear?And will not Emily receiveThis lovely chronicler of thingsLong past, delights and sorrowings?Lone Sufferer! will not she believeThe promise in that speaking face;And welcome, as a gift of grace,The saddest thought the Creature brings?That day, the first of a re-union Which was to teem with high communion,That day of balmy April weather,They tarried in the wood together.And when, ere fall of evening dew,She from her sylvan haunt withdrew,The White Doe tracked with faithful paceThe Lady to her dwelling-place;That nook where, on paternal ground,A habitation she had found,The Master of whose humble board Once owned her Father for his Lord;A hut, by tufted trees defended,Where Rylstone brook with Wharf is blended.When Emily by morning lightWent forth, the Doe stood there in sight.She shrunk:--with one frail shock of painReceived and followed by a prayer,She saw the Creature once again;Shun will she not, she feels, will bear;--But, wheresoever she looked round, All now was trouble-haunted ground;And therefore now she deems it goodOnce more this restless neighbourhoodTo leave.--Unwooed, yet unforbidden,The White Doe followed up the vale,Up to another cottage, hiddenIn the deep fork of Amerdale;And there may Emily restoreHerself, in spots unseen before.--Why tell of mossy rock, or tree, By lurking Dernbrook\'s pathless side,Haunts of a strengthening amityThat calmed her, cheered, and fortified?For she hath ventured now to readOf time, and place, and thought, and deed--Endless history that liesIn her silent Follower\'s eyes;Who with a power like human reasonDiscerns the favourable season,Skilled to approach or to retire,-- From looks conceiving her desire;From look, deportment, voice, or mien,That vary to the heart within.If she too passionately wreathedHer arms, or over-deeply breathed,Walked quick or slowly, every moodIn its degree was understood;Then well may their accord be true,And kindliest intercourse ensue.--Oh! surely \'twas a gentle rousing When she by sudden glimpse espiedThe White Doe on the mountain browsing,Or in the meadow wandered wide!How pleased, when down the Straggler sankBeside her, on some sunny bank!How soothed, when in thick bower enclosed,They, like a nested pair, reposed!Fair Vision! when it crossed the MaidWithin some rocky cavern laid,The dark cave\'s portal gliding by, White as whitest cloud on highFloating through the azure sky.--What now is left for pain or fear?That Presence, dearer and more dear,While they, side by side, were straying,And the shepherd\'s pipe was playing,Did now a very gladness yieldAt morning to the dewy field,And with a deeper peace enduedThe hour of moonlight solitude. With her Companion, in such frameOf mind, to Rylstone back she came;And, ranging through the wasted groves,Received the memory of old loves,Undisturbed and undistrest,Into a soul which now was blestWith a soft spring-day of holy,Mild, and grateful, melancholy:Not sunless gloom or unenlightened,But by tender fancies brightened. When the bells of Rylstone playedTheir sabbath music--\'God us ayde!\'That was the sound they seemed to speak;Inscriptive legend which I weenMay on those holy bells be seen,That legend and her Grandsire\'s name;And oftentimes the Lady meekHad in her childhood read the same;Words which she slighted at that day;But now, when such sad change was wrought, And of that lonely name she thought--The bells of Rylstone seemed to say,While she sate listening in the shade,With vocal music, \'God us ayde;\'And all the hills were glad to bearTheir part in this effectual prayer.Nor lacked she Reason\'s firmest power;But with the White Doe at her sideUp would she climb to Norton Tower,And thence look round her far and wide, Her fate there measuring;--all is stilled,--The weak One hath subdued her heart;Behold the prophecy fulfilled,Fulfilled, and she sustains her part!But here her Brother\'s words have failed;Here hath a milder doom prevailed;That she, of him and all bereft,Hath yet this faithful Partner left;This one Associate, that disprovesHis words, remains for her, and loves. If tears are shed, they do not fallFor loss of him--for one, or all;Yet, sometimes, sometimes doth she weepMoved gently in her soul\'s soft sleep;A few tears down her cheek descendFor this her last and living Friend.Bless, tender Hearts, their mutual lot,And bless for both this savage spot;Which Emily doth sacred holdFor reasons dear and manifold-- Here hath she, here before her sight,Close to the summit of this height,The grassy rock-encircled PoundIn which the Creature first was found.So beautiful the timid Thrall(A spotless Youngling white as foam)Her youngest Brother brought it home;The youngest, then a lusty boy,Bore it, or led, to Rylstone-hallWith heart brimful of pride and joy! But most to Bolton\'s sacred Pile,On favouring nights, she loved to go;There ranged through cloister, court, and aisle,Attended by the soft-paced Doe;Nor feared she in the still moonshineTo look upon Saint Mary\'s shrine;Nor on the lonely turf that showedWhere Francis slept in his last abode.For that she came; there oft she sateForlorn, but not disconsolate: And, when she from the abyss returnedOf thought, she neither shrunk nor mourned;Was happy that she lived to greetHer mute Companion as it layIn love and pity at her feet;How happy in its turn to meetThe recognition! the mild glanceBeamed from that gracious countenance;Communication, like the rayOf a new morning, to the nature And prospects of the inferior Creature!A mortal Song we sing, by dowerEncouraged of celestial power;Power which the viewless Spirit shedBy whom we were first visited;Whose voice we heard, whose hand and wingsSwept like a breeze the conscious strings,When, left in solitude, erewhileWe stood before this ruined Pile,And, quitting unsubstantial dreams, Sang in this Presence kindred themes;Distress and desolation spreadThrough human hearts, and pleasure dead,--Dead--but to live again on earth,A second and yet nobler birth;Dire overthrow, and yet how highThe re-ascent in sanctity!From fair to fairer; day by dayA more divine and loftier way!Even such this blessed Pilgrim trod, By sorrow lifted towards her God;Uplifted to the purest skyOf undisturbed mortality.Her own thoughts loved she; and could bendA dear look to her lowly Friend;There stopped; her thirst was satisfiedWith what this innocent spring supplied:Her sanction inwardly she bore,And stood apart from human cares:But to the world returned no more, Although with no unwilling mindHelp did she give at need, and joinedThe Wharfdale peasants in their prayers.At length, thus faintly, faintly tiedTo earth, she was set free, and died.Thy soul, exalted Emily,Maid of the blasted family,Rose to the God from whom it came!--In Rylstone Church her mortal frameWas buried by her Mother\'s side. Most glorious sunset! and a raySurvives--the twilight of this day--In that fair Creature whom the fieldsSupport, and whom the forest shields;Who, having filled a holy place,Partakes, in her degree, Heaven\'s grace;And bears a memory and a mindRaised far above the law of kind;Haunting the spots with lonely cheerWhich her dear Mistress once held dear: Loves most what Emily loved most--The enclosure of this churchyard ground;Here wanders like a gliding ghost,And every sabbath here is found;Comes with the people when the bellsAre heard among the moorland dells,Finds entrance through yon arch, where wayLies open on the sabbath-day;Here walks amid the mournful wasteOf prostrate altars, shrines defaced, And floors encumbered with rich showOf fret-work imagery laid low;Paces softly, or makes halt,By fractured cell, or tomb, or vault;By plate of monumental brassDim-gleaming among weeds and grass,And sculptured Forms of Warriors brave:But chiefly by that single grave,That one sequestered hillock green,The pensive visitant is seen. There doth the gentle Creature lieWith those adversities unmoved;Calm spectacle, by earth and skyIn their benignity approved!And aye, methinks, this hoary Pile,Subdued by outrage and decay,Looks down upon her with a smile,A gracious smile, that seems to say--\'Thou, thou art not a Child of Time,But Daughter of the Eternal Prime!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Recluse  -  Book First\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHOME AT GRASMEREONCE to the verge of yon steep barrier cameA roving school-boy; what the adventurer\'s ageHath now escaped his memory--but the hour,One of a golden summer holiday,He well remembers, though the year be gone--Alone and devious from afar he came;And, with a sudden influx overpoweredAt sight of this seclusion, he forgotHis haste, for hasty had his footsteps beenAs boyish his pursuits; and sighing said, \'What happy fortune were it here to live!And, if a thought of dying, if a thoughtOf mortal separation, could intrudeWith paradise before him, here to die!\'No Prophet was he, had not even a hope,Scarcely a wish, but one bright pleasing thought,A fancy in the heart of what might beThe lot of others, never could be his.The station whence he looked was soft and green,Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth Of vale below, a height of hills above.For rest of body perfect was the spot,All that luxurious nature could desire;But stirring to the spirit; who could gazeAnd not feel motions there? He thought of cloudsThat sail on winds: of breezes that delightTo play on water, or in endless chasePursue each other through the yielding plainOf grass or corn, over and through and through,In billow after billow, evermore Disporting--nor unmindful was the boyOf sunbeams, shadows, butterflies and birds;Of fluttering sylphs and softly-gliding Fays,Genii, and winged angels that are LordsWithout restraint of all which they behold.The illusion strengthening as he gazed, he feltThat such unfettered liberty was his,Such power and joy; but only for this end,To flit from field to rock, from rock to field,From shore to island, and from isle to shore, From open ground to covert, from a bedOf meadow-flowers into a tuft of wood;From high to low, from low to high, yet stillWithin the bound of this huge concave; hereMust be his home, this valley be his world.Since that day forth the Place to him--\'to me\'(For I who live to register the truthWas that same young and happy Being) becameAs beautiful to thought, as it had beenWhen present, to the bodily sense; a haunt Of pure affections, shedding upon joyA brighter joy; and through such damp and gloomOf the gay mind, as ofttimes splenetic youthMistakes for sorrow, darting beams of lightThat no self-cherished sadness could withstand;And now \'tis mine, perchance for life, dear Vale,Beloved Grasmere (let the wandering streamsTake up, the cloud-capt hills repeat, the Name)One of thy lowly Dwellings is my Home.And was the cost so great? and could it seem An act of courage, and the thing itselfA conquest? who must bear the blame? Sage manThy prudence, thy experience, thy desires,Thy apprehensions--blush thou for them all.Yes the realities of life so cold,So cowardly, so ready to betray,So stinted in the measure of their graceAs we pronounce them, doing them much wrong,Have been to me more bountiful than hope,Less timid than desire--but that is past. On Nature\'s invitation do I come,By Reason sanctioned. Can the choice mislead,That made the calmest fairest spot of earthWith all its unappropriated goodMy own; and not mine only, for with meEntrenched, say rather peacefully embowered,Under yon orchard, in yon humble cot,A younger Orphan of a home extinct,The only Daughter of my Parents dwells.Ay, think on that, my heart, and cease to stir, Pause upon that and let the breathing frameNo longer breathe, but all be satisfied.--Oh, if such silence be not thanks to GodFor what hath been bestowed, then where, where thenShall gratitude find rest? Mine eyes did ne\'erFix on a lovely object, nor my mindTake pleasure in the midst of happy thoughts,But either She whom now I have, who nowDivides with me this loved abode, was there,Or not far off. Where\'er my footsteps turned, Her voice was like a hidden Bird that sang,The thought of her was like a flash of light,Or an unseen companionship, a breathOf fragrance independent of the Wind.In all my goings, in the new and oldOf all my meditations, and in thisFavourite of all, in this the most of all.--What being, therefore, since the birth of ManHad ever more abundant cause to speakThanks, and if favours of the Heavenly Muse Make him more thankful, then to call on VerseTo aid him and in song resound his joy?The boon is absolute; surpassing graceTo me hath been vouchsafed; among the bowersOf blissful Eden this was neither givenNor could be given, possession of the goodWhich had been sighed for, ancient thought fulfilled,And dear Imaginations realised,Up to their highest measure, yea and more.Embrace me then, ye Hills, and close me in; Now in the clear and open day I feelYour guardianship; I take it to my heart;\'Tis like the solemn shelter of the night.But I would call thee beautiful, for mild,And soft, and gay, and beautiful thou artDear Valley, having in thy face a smileThough peaceful, full of gladness. Thou art pleased,Pleased with thy crags and woody steeps, thy Lake,Its one green island and its winding shores;The multitude of little rocky hills, Thy Church and cottages of mountain stoneClustered like stars some few, but single most,And lurking dimly in their shy retreats,Or glancing at each other cheerful looksLike separated stars with clouds between.What want we? have we not perpetual streams,Warm woods, and sunny hills, and fresh green fields,And mountains not less green, and flocks and herds,And thickets full of songsters, and the voiceOf lordly birds, an unexpected sound Heard now and then from morn to latest eve,Admonishing the man who walks belowOf solitude and silence in the sky?These have we, and a thousand nooks of earthHave also these, but nowhere else is found,Nowhere (or is it fancy?) can be foundThe one sensation that is here; \'tis here,Here as it found its way into my heartIn childhood, here as it abides by day,By night, here only; or in chosen minds That take it with them hence, where\'er they go.--\'Tis, but I cannot name it, \'tis the senseOf majesty, and beauty, and repose,A blended holiness of earth and sky,Something that makes this individual spot,This small abiding-place of many men,A termination, and a last retreat,A centre, come from wheresoe\'er you will,A whole without dependence or defect,Made for itself, and happy in itself, Perfect contentment, Unity entire.Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak,When hitherward we journeyed side by sideThrough burst of sunshine and through flying showers;Paced the long vales--how long they were--and yetHow fast that length of way was left behind,Wensley\'s rich Vale, and Sedbergh\'s naked heights.The frosty wind, as if to make amendsFor its keen breath, was aiding to our steps,And drove us onward like two ships at sea, Or like two birds, companions in mid-air,Parted and reunited by the blast.Stern was the face of nature; we rejoicedIn that stern countenance, for our souls thence drewA feeling of their strength. The naked trees,The icy brooks, as on we passed, appearedTo question us. \'Whence come ye, to what end?\'They seemed to say, \'What would ye,\' said the shower,\'Wild Wanderers, whither through my dark domain?\'The sunbeam said, \'Be happy.\' When this vale We entered, bright and solemn was the skyThat faced us with a passionate welcoming,And led us to our threshold. Daylight failedInsensibly, and round us gently fellComposing darkness, with a quiet loadOf full contentment, in a little shedDisturbed, uneasy in itself as seemed,And wondering at its new inhabitants.It loves us now, this Vale so beautifulBegins to love us! by a sullen storm, Two months unwearied of severest storm,It put the temper of our minds to proof,And found us faithful through the gloom, and heardThe poet mutter his prelusive songsWith cheerful heart, an unknown voice of joyAmong the silence of the woods and hills;Silent to any gladsomeness of soundWith all their shepherds.But the gates of SpringAre opened; churlish winter hath given leaveThat she should entertain for this one day, Perhaps for many genial days to come,His guests, and make them jocund.--They are pleased,But most of all the birds that haunt the floodWith the mild summons; inmates though they beOf Winter\'s household, they keep festivalThis day, who drooped, or seemed to droop, so long;They show their pleasure, and shall I do less?Happier of happy though I be, like themI cannot take possession of the sky,Mount with a thoughtless impulse, and wheel there One of a mighty multitude, whose wayIs a perpetual harmony and danceMagnificent. Behold how with a graceOf ceaseless motion, that might scarcely seemInferior to angelical, they prolongTheir curious pastime, shaping in mid-air,And sometimes with ambitious wing that soarsHigh as the level of the mountain tops,A circuit ampler than the lake beneath,Their own domain;--but ever, while intent On tracing and retracing that large round,Their jubilant activity evolvesHundreds of curves and circlets, to and fro,Upwards and downwards; progress intricateYet unperplexed, as if one spirit swayedTheir indefatigable flight. \'Tis done,Ten times and more I fancied it had ceased,But lo! the vanished company againAscending, they approach. I hear their wingsFaint, faint at first; and then an eager sound Passed in a moment--and as faint again!They tempt the sun to sport among their plumes;Tempt the smooth water, or the gleaming ice,To show them a fair image,--\'tis themselves,Their own fair forms upon the glimmering plainPainted more soft and fair as they descend,Almost to touch,--then up again aloft,Up with a sally and a flash of speed,As if they scorned both resting-place and rest!--This day is a thanksgiving, \'tis a day Of glad emotion and deep quietness;Not upon me alone hath been bestowed,Me rich in many onward-looking thoughts,The penetrating bliss; oh surely theseHave felt it, not the happy choirs of spring,Her own peculiar family of loveThat sport among green leaves, a blither train!But two are missing, two, a lonely pairOf milk-white Swans; wherefore are they not seenPartaking this day\'s pleasure? From afar They came, to sojourn here in solitude,Choosing this Valley, they who had the choiceOf the whole world. We saw them day by day,Through those two months of unrelenting storm,Conspicuous at the centre of the LakeTheir safe retreat, we knew them well, I guessThat the whole valley knew them; but to usThey were more dear than may be well believed,Not only for their beauty, and their stillAnd placid way of life, and constant love Inseparable, not for these alone,But that \'their\' state so much resembled ours,They having also chosen this abode;They strangers, and we strangers, they a pair,And we a solitary pair like them.They should not have departed; many daysDid I look forth in vain, nor on the wingCould see them, nor in that small open spaceOf blue unfrozen water, where they lodgedAnd lived so long in quiet, side by side. Shall we behold them consecrated friends,Faithful companions, yet another yearSurviving, they for us, and we for them,And neither pair be broken? nay perchanceIt is too late already for such hope;The Dalesmen may have aimed the deadly tube,And parted them; or haply both are goneOne death, and that were mercy given to both.Recall, my song, the ungenerous thought; forgive,Thrice favoured Region, the conjecture harsh Of such inhospitable penaltyInflicted upon confidence so pure.Ah! if I wished to follow where the sightOf all that is before my eyes, the voiceWhich speaks from a presiding spirit here,Would lead me, I should whisper to myself:They who are dwellers in this holy placeMust needs themselves be hallowed, they requireNo benediction from the stranger\'s lips,For they are blessed already; none would give The greeting \'peace be with you\' unto them,For peace they have; it cannot but be theirs,And mercy, and forbearance--nay--not these--\'Their\' healing offices a pure good-willPrecludes, and charity beyond the boundsOf charity--an overflowing love;Not for the creature only, but for allThat is around them; love for everythingWhich in their happy Region they behold!Thus do we soothe ourselves, and when the thought Is passed, we blame it not for having come.--What if I floated down a pleasant stream,And now am landed, and the motion gone,Shall I reprove myself? Ah no, the streamIs flowing, and will never cease to flow,And I shall float upon that stream again.By such forgetfulness the soul becomes,Words cannot say how beautiful: then hail,Hail to the visible Presence, hail to thee,Delightful Valley, habitation fair! And to whatever else of outward formCan give an inward help, can purify,And elevate, and harmonise, and soothe,And steal away, and for a while deceiveAnd lap in pleasing rest, and bear us onWithout desire in full complacency,Contemplating perfection absolute,And entertained as in a placid sleep.But not betrayed by tenderness of mindThat feared, or wholly overlooked the truth, Did we come hither, with romantic hopeTo find in midst of so much lovelinessLove, perfect love: of so much majestyA like majestic-frame of mind in thoseWho here abide, the persons like the place.Not from such hope, or aught of such belief,Hath issued any portion of the joyWhich I have felt this day. An awful voice\'Tis true hath in my walks been often heard,Sent from the mountains or the sheltered fields, Shout after shout--reiterated whoop,In manner of a bird that takes delightIn answering to itself: or like a houndSingle at chase among the lonely woods,His yell repeating; yet it was in truthA human voice--a spirit of coming night;How solemn when the sky is dark, and earthNot dark, nor yet enlightened, but by snowMade visible, amid a noise of windsAnd bleatings manifold of mountain sheep, Which in that iteration recogniseTheir summons, and are gathering round for food,Devoured with keenness, ere to grove or bankOr rocky bield with patience they retire.That very voice, which, in some timid moodOf superstitious fancy, might have seemedAwful as ever stray demoniac uttered,His steps to govern in the wilderness;Or as the Norman Curfew\'s regular beatTo hearths when first they darkened at the knell: That shepherd\'s voice, it may have reached mine earDebased and under profanation, madeThe ready organ of articulate soundsFrom ribaldry, impiety, or wrath,Issuing when shame hath ceased to check the brawlsOf some abused Festivity--so be it.I came not dreaming of unruffled life,Untainted manners; born among the hills,Bred also there, I wanted not a scaleTo regulate my hopes; pleased with the good I shrink not from the evil with disgust,Or with immoderate pain. I look for Man,The common creature of the brotherhood,Differing but little from the Man elsewhere,For selfishness and envy and revenge,Ill neighbourhood--pity that this should be--Flattery and double-dealing, strife and wrong.Yet is it something gained, it is in truthA mighty gain, that Labour here preservesHis rosy face, a servant only here Of the fireside or of the open field,A Freeman therefore sound and unimpaired:That extreme penury is here unknown,And cold and hunger\'s abject wretchednessMortal to body and the heaven-born mind:That they who want are not too great a weightFor those who can relieve; here may the heartBreathe in the air of fellow-sufferingDreadless, as in a kind of fresher breezeOf her own native element, the hand Be ready and unwearied without plea,From tasks too frequent or beyond its power,For languor or indifference or despair.And as these lofty barriers break the forceOf winds,--this deep Vale, as it doth in partConceal us from the storm, so here abidesA power and a protection for the mind,Dispensed indeed to other solitudesFavoured by noble privilege like this,Where kindred independence of estate Is prevalent, where he who tills the field,He, happy man! is master of the field,And treads the mountains which his Fathers trod.Not less than halfway up yon mountain\'s side,Behold a dusky spot, a grove of FirsThat seems still smaller than it is; this groveIs haunted--by what ghost? a gentle spiritOf memory faithful to the call of love;For, as reports the Dame, whose fire sends upYon curling smoke from the grey cot below, The trees (her first-born child being then a babe)Were planted by her husband and herself,That ranging o\'er the high and houseless groundTheir sheep might neither want from perilous stormOf winter, nor from summer\'s sultry heat,A friendly covert; \'and they knew it well,\'Said she, \'for thither as the trees grew upWe to the patient creatures carried foodIn times of heavy snow.\' She then beganIn fond obedience to her private thoughts To speak of her dead husband; is there notAn art, a music, and a strain of wordsThat shall be life, the acknowledged voice of life,Shall speak of what is done among the fields,Done truly there, or felt, of solid goodAnd real evil, yet be sweet withal,More grateful, more harmonious than the breath,The idle breath of softest pipe attunedTo pastoral fancies? Is there such a streamPure and unsullied flowing from the heart With motions of true dignity and grace?Or must we seek that stream where Man is not?Methinks I could repeat in tuneful verse,Delicious as the gentlest breeze that soundsThrough that aerial fir-grove--could preserveSome portion of its human historyAs gathered from the Matron\'s lips, and tellOf tears that have been shed at sight of it,And moving dialogues between this PairWho in their prime of wedlock, with joint hands Did plant the grove, now flourishing, while theyNo longer flourish, he entirely gone,She withering in her loneliness. Be thisA task above my skill--the silent mindHas her own treasures, and I think of these,Love what I see, and honour humankind.No, we are not alone, we do not stand,My sister here misplaced and desolate,Loving what no one cares for but ourselves,We shall not scatter through the plains and rocks Of this fair Vale, and o\'er its spacious heights,Unprofitable kindliness, bestowedOn objects unaccustomed to the giftsOf feeling, which were cheerless and forlornBut few weeks past, and would be so againWere we not here; we do not tend a lampWhose lustre we alone participate,Which shines dependent upon us alone,Mortal though bright, a dying, dying flame.Look where we will, some human hand has been Before us with its offering; not a treeSprinkles these little pastures, but the sameHath furnished matter for a thought; perchanceFor some one serves as a familiar friend.Joy spreads, and sorrow spreads; and this whole Vale,Home of untutored shepherds as it is,Swarms with sensation, as with gleams of sunshine,Shadows or breezes, scents or sounds. Nor deemThese feelings, though subservient more than oursTo every day\'s demand for daily bread, And borrowing more their spirit and their shapeFrom self-respecting interests; deem them notUnworthy therefore, and unhallowed--no,They lift the animal being, do themselvesBy nature\'s kind and ever-present aidRefine the selfishness from which they spring,Redeem by love the individual senseOf anxiousness, with which they are combined.And thus it is that fitly they becomeAssociates in the joy of purest minds: They blend therewith congenially: meanwhileCalmly they breathe their own undying lifeThrough this their mountain sanctuary; longOh long may it remain inviolate,Diffusing health and sober cheerfulness,And giving to the moments as they passTheir little boons of animating thoughtThat sweeten labour, make it seen and feltTo be no arbitrary weight imposed,But a glad function natural to man. Fair proof of this, newcomer though I be,Already have I gained; the inward frame,Though slowly opening, opens every dayWith process not unlike to that which cheersA pensive stranger journeying at his leisureThrough some Helvetian Dell; when low-hung mistsBreak up and are beginning to recede;How pleased he is where thin and thinner growsThe veil, or where it parts at once, to spyThe dark pines thrusting forth their spiky heads; To watch the spreading lawns with cattle grazed;Then to be greeted by the scattered hutsAs they shine out; and \'see\' the streams whose murmurHad soothed his ear while \'they\' were hidden; how pleasedTo have about him which way e\'er he goesSomething on every side concealed from view,In every quarter something visibleHalf seen or wholly, lost and found again,Alternate progress and impediment,And yet a growing prospect in the main. Such pleasure now is mine, albeit forced,Herein less happy than the Traveller,To cast from time to time a painful lookUpon unwelcome things which unawaresReveal themselves, not therefore is my heartDepressed, nor does it fear what is to come;But confident, enriched at every glance,The more I see the more delight my mindReceives, or by reflection can create:Truth justifies herself, and as she dwells With Hope, who would not follow where she leads?Nor let me pass unheeded other lovesWhere no fear is, and humbler sympathies.Already hath sprung up within my heartA liking for the small grey horse that bearsThe paralytic man, and for the bruteIn Scripture sanctified--the patient bruteOn which the cripple, in the quarry maimed,Rides to and fro: I know them and their ways.The famous sheep-dog, first in all the vale, Though yet to me a stranger, will not beA stranger long; nor will the blind man\'s guide,Meek and neglected thing, of no renown!Soon will peep forth the primrose, ere it fadesFriends shall I have at dawn, blackbird and thrushTo rouse me, and a hundred warblers more!And if those Eagles to their ancient holdReturn, Helvellyn\'s Eagles! with the PairFrom my own door I shall be free to claimAcquaintance, as they sweep from cloud to cloud. The owl that gives the name to Owlet-CragHave I heard whooping, and he soon will beA chosen one of my regards. See thereThe heifer in yon little croft belongsTo one who holds it dear; with duteous careShe reared it, and in speaking of her chargeI heard her scatter some endearing wordsDomestic, and in spirit motherly,She being herself a mother; happy Beast,If the caresses of a human voice Can make it so, and care of human hands.And ye as happy under Nature\'s care,Strangers to me and all men, or at leastStrangers to all particular amity,All intercourse of knowledge or of loveThat parts the individual from his kind.Whether in large communities ye keepFrom year to year, not shunning man\'s abode,A settled residence, or be from farWild creatures, and of many homes, that come The gift of winds, and whom the winds againTake from us at your pleasure; yet shall yeNot want for this your own subordinate placeIn my affections. Witness the delightWith which erewhile I saw that multitudeWheel through the sky, and see them now at rest,Yet not at rest upon the glassy lake:They \'cannot\' rest--they gambol like young whelps;Active as lambs, and overcome with joyThey try all frolic motions; flutter, plunge, And beat the passive water with their wings.Too distant are they for plain view, but lo!Those little fountains, sparkling in the sun,Betray their occupation, rising upFirst one and then another silver spout,As one or other takes the fit of glee,Fountains and spouts, yet somewhat in the guiseOf plaything fireworks, that on festal nightsSparkle about the feet of wanton boys.--How vast the compass of this theatre, Yet nothing to be seen but lovely pompAnd silent majesty; the birch-tree woodsAre hung with thousand thousand diamond dropsOf melted hoar-frost, every tiny knotIn the bare twigs, each little budding-placeCased with its several beads; what myriads theseUpon one tree, while all the distant grove,That rises to the summit of the steep,Shows like a mountain built of silver light:See yonder the same pageant, and again Behold the universal imageryInverted, all its sun-bright features touchedAs with the varnish and the gloss of dreams.Dreamlike the blending also of the wholeHarmonious landscape: all along the shoreThe boundary lost--the line invisibleThat parts the image from reality;And the clear hills, as high as they ascendHeavenward, so deep piercing the lake below.Admonished of the days of love to come The raven croaks, and fills the upper airWith a strange sound of genial harmony;And in and all about that playful band,Incapable although they be of rest,And in their fashion very rioters,There is a stillness, and they seem to makeCalm revelry in that their calm abode.Them leaving to their joyous hours I pass,Pass with a thought the life of the whole yearThat is to come: the throng of woodland flowers And lilies that will dance upon the waves.Say boldly then that solitude is notWhere these things are: he truly is alone,He of the multitude whose eyes are doomedTo hold a vacant commerce day by dayWith Objects wanting life--repelling love;He by the vast metropolis immured,Where pity shrinks from unremitting calls,Where numbers overwhelm humanity,And neighbourhood serves rather to divide Than to unite--what sighs more deep than his,Whose nobler will hath long been sacrificed;Who must inhabit under a black skyA city, where, if indifference to disgustYield not to scorn or sorrow, living menAre ofttimes to their fellow-men no moreThan to the forest Hermit are the leavesThat hang aloft in myriads; nay, far less,For they protect his walk from sun and shower,Swell his devotion with their voice in storms, And whisper while the stars twinkle among themHis lullaby. From crowded streets remote,Far from the living and dead WildernessOf the thronged world, Society is hereA true community--a genuine frameOf many into one incorporate.\'That\' must be looked for here: paternal sway,One household, under God, for high and low,One family and one mansion; to themselvesAppropriate, and divided from the world, As if it were a cave, a multitudeHuman and brute, possessors undisturbedOf this Recess--their legislative Hall,Their Temple, and their glorious Dwelling-place.Dismissing therefore all Arcadian dreams,All golden fancies of the golden age,The bright array of shadowy thoughts from timesThat were before all time, or are to beEre time expire, the pageantry that stirsOr will be stirring, when our eyes are fixed On lovely objects, and we wish to partWith all remembrance of a jarring world,--Take we at once this one sufficient hope,What need of more? that we shall neither droopNor pine for want of pleasure in the lifeScattered about us, nor through want of aughtThat keeps in health the insatiable mind.--That we shall have for knowledge and for loveAbundance, and that feeling as we doHow goodly, how exceeding fair, how pure From all reproach is yon ethereal vault,And this deep Vale, its earthly counterpart,By which and under which we are enclosedTo breathe in peace; we shall moreover find(If sound, and what we ought to be ourselves,If rightly we observe and justly weigh)The inmates not unworthy of their home,The Dwellers of their Dwelling.And if thisWere otherwise, we have within ourselvesEnough to fill the present day with joy, And overspread the future years with hope,Our beautiful and quiet home, enrichedAlready with a stranger whom we loveDeeply, a stranger of our Father\'s house,A never-resting Pilgrim of the Sea,Who finds at last an hour to his contentBeneath our roof. And others whom we loveWill seek us also, Sisters of our hearts,And one, like them, a Brother of our hearts,Philosopher and Poet, in whose sight These mountains will rejoice with open joy.--Such is our wealth! O Vale of Peace we areAnd must be, with God\'s will, a happy Band.Yet \'tis not to enjoy that we exist,For that end only; something must be done:I must not walk in unreproved delightThese narrow bounds, and think of nothing more,No duty that looks further, and no care.Each Being has his office, lowly someAnd common, yet all worthy if fulfilled With zeal, acknowledgment that with the giftKeeps pace a harvest answering to the seed.Of ill-advised Ambition and of PrideI would stand clear, but yet to me I feelThat an internal brightness is vouchsafedThat must not die, that must not pass away.Why does this inward lustre fondly seekAnd gladly blend with outward fellowship?Why do \'they\' shine around me whom I love?Why do they teach me, whom I thus revere? Strange question, yet it answers not itself.That humble Roof embowered among the trees,That calm fireside, it is not even in them,Blest as they are, to furnish a replyThat satisfies and ends in perfect rest.Possessions have I that are solely mine,Something within which yet is shared by none,Not even the nearest to me and most dear,Something which power and effort may impart;I would impart it, I would spread it wide: Immortal in the world which is to come--Forgive me if I add another claim--And would not wholly perish even in this,Lie down and be forgotten in the dust,I and the modest Partners of my daysMaking a silent company in death;Love, knowledge, all my manifold delights,All buried with me without monumentOr profit unto any but ourselves!It must not be, if I, divinely taught, Be privileged to speak as I have feltOf what in man is human or divine.While yet an innocent little one, with a heartThat doubtless wanted not its tender moods,I breathed (for this I better recollect)Among wild appetites and blind desires,Motions of savage instinct my delightAnd exaltation. Nothing at that timeSo welcome, no temptation half so dearAs that which urged me to a daring feat, Deep pools, tall trees, black chasms, and dizzy crags,And tottering towers: I loved to stand and readTheir looks forbidding, read and disobey,Sometimes in act and evermore in thought.With impulses, that scarcely were by theseSurpassed in strength, I heard of danger metOr sought with courage; enterprise forlornBy one, sole keeper of his own intent,Or by a resolute few, who for the sakeOf glory fronted multitudes in arms. Yea, to this hour I cannot read a TaleOf two brave vessels matched in deadly fight,And fighting to the death, but I am pleasedMore than a wise man ought to be; I wish,Fret, burn, and struggle, and in soul am there.But me hath Nature tamed, and bade to seekFor other agitations, or be calm;Hath dealt with me as with a turbulent stream,Some nursling of the mountains which she leadsThrough quiet meadows, after he has learnt His strength, and had his triumph and his joy,His desperate course of tumult and of glee.That which in stealth by Nature was performedHath Reason sanctioned: her deliberate VoiceHath said; be mild, and cleave to gentle things,Thy glory and thy happiness be there.Nor fear, though thou confide in me, a wantOf aspirations that have been--of foesTo wrestle with, and victory to complete,Bounds to be leapt, darkness to be explored; All that inflamed thy infant heart, the love,The longing, the contempt, the undaunted quest,All shall survive, though changed their office, allShall live, it is not in their power to die.Then farewell to the Warrior\'s Schemes, farewellThe forwardness of soul which looks that wayUpon a less incitement than the CauseOf Liberty endangered, and farewellThat other hope, long mine, the hope to fillThe heroic trumpet with the Muse\'s breath! Yet in this peaceful Vale we will not spendUnheard-of days, though loving peaceful thought,A voice shall speak, and what will be the theme?On Man, on Nature, and on Human Life,Musing in solitude, I oft perceiveFair trains of imagery before me rise,Accompanied by feelings of delightPure, or with no unpleasing sadness mixed;And I am conscious of affecting thoughtsAnd dear remembrances, whose presence soothes Or elevates the Mind, intent to weighThe good and evil of our mortal state.--To these emotions, whencesoe\'er they come,Whether from breath of outward circumstance,Or from the Soul--an impulse to herself--I would give utterance in numerous verse.Of Truth, of Grandeur, Beauty, Love, and Hope,And melancholy Fear subdued by Faith;Of blessed consolations in distress;Of moral strength, and intellectual Power; Of joy in widest commonalty spread;Of the individual Mind that keeps her ownInviolate retirement, subject thereTo Conscience only, and the law supremeOf that Intelligence which governs all--I sing:--\'fit audience let me find though few!\'So prayed, more gaining than he asked, the Bard--In holiest mood. Urania, I shall needThy guidance, or a greater Muse, if suchDescend to earth or dwell in highest heaven!

For all--all dying in one hour!--Why comes not Francis? Thoughts of loveShould bear him to his Sister dearWith the fleet motion of a dove;Yea, like a heavenly messengerOf speediest wing, should he appear.Why comes he not?--for westward fastAlong the plain of York he past;Reckless of what impels or leads,Unchecked he hurries on;--nor heeds The sorrow, through the Villages,Spread by triumphant crueltiesOf vengeful military force,And punishment without remorse.He marked not, heard not, as he fledAll but the suffering heart was deadFor him abandoned to blank awe,To vacancy, and horror strong:And the first object which he saw,With conscious sight, as he swept along-- It was the Banner in his hand!He felt--and made a sudden stand.He looked about like one betrayed:What hath he done? what promise made?Oh weak, weak moment! to what endCan such a vain oblation tend,And he the Bearer?--Can he goCarrying this instrument of woe,And find, find anywhere, a rightTo excuse him in his Country\'s sight? No; will not all men deem the changeA downward course, perverse and strange?Here is it;--but how? when? must she,The unoffending Emily,Again this piteous object see?Such conflict long did he maintain,Nor liberty nor rest could gain:His own life into danger broughtBy this sad burden--even that thought,Exciting self-suspicion strong Swayed the brave man to his wrong.And how--unless it were the senseOf all-disposing Providence,Its will unquestionably shown--How has the Banner clung so fastTo a palsied, and unconscious hand;Clung to the hand to which it passedWithout impediment? And why,But that Heaven\'s purpose might be known,Doth now no hindrance meet his eye, No intervention, to withstandFulfilment of a Father\'s prayerBreathed to a Son forgiven, and blestWhen all resentments were at rest,And life in death laid the heart bare?--Then, like a spectre sweeping by,Rushed through his mind the prophecyOf utter desolation madeTo Emily in the yew-tree shade:He sighed, submitting will and power To the stern embrace of that grasping hour.\'No choice is left, the deed is mine--Dead are they, dead!--and I will go,And, for their sakes, come weal or woe,Will lay the Relic on the shrine.\'So forward with a steady willHe went, and traversed plain and hill;And up the vale of Wharf his wayPursued;--and, at the dawn of day,Attained a summit whence his eyes Could see the Tower of Bolton rise.There Francis for a moment\'s spaceMade halt--but hark! a noise behindOf horsemen at an eager pace!He heard, and with misgiving mind.--\'Tis Sir George Bowes who leads the Band:They come, by cruel Sussex sent;Who, when the Nortons from the handOf death had drunk their punishment,Bethought him, angry and ashamed, How Francis, with the Banner claimedAs his own charge, had disappeared,By all the standers-by revered.His whole bold carriage (which had quelledThus far the Opposer, and repelledAll censure, enterprise so brightThat even bad men had vainly strivenAgainst that overcoming light)Was then reviewed, and prompt word given,That to what place soever fled He should be seized, alive or dead.The troop of horse have gained the heightWhere Francis stood in open sight.They hem him round--\'Behold the proof,\'They cried, \'the Ensign in his hand!\'He\' did not arm, he walked aloof!For why?--to save his Father\'s land;--Worst Traitor of them all is he,A Traitor dark and cowardly!\'\'I am no Traitor,\' Francis said, \'Though this unhappy freight I bear;And must not part with.

\'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,And Benjamin, without a question,Taking her for some way-worn rover,Said, \'Mount, and get you under cover!\'Another voice, in tone as hoarseAs a swoln brook with rugged course,Cried out, \'Good brother, why so fast?I\'ve had a glimpse of you--\'avast!\'Or, since it suits you to be civil,Take her at once--for good and evil!\' \'It is my Husband,\' softly saidThe Woman, as if half afraid:By this time she was snug within,Through help of honest Benjamin;She and her Babe, which to her breastWith thankfulness the Mother pressed;And now the same strong voice more nearSaid cordially, \'My Friend, what cheer?Rough doings these!

The past he calmly hath reviewed:But where will be the fortitudeOf this brave man, when he shall seeThat Form beneath the spreading tree,And know that it is Emily?He saw her where in open viewShe sate beneath the spreading yew--Her head upon her lap, concealingIn solitude her bitter feeling:\'Might ever son \'command\' a sire, The act were justified to-day.\'This to himself--and to the Maid,Whom now he had approached, he said--\'Gone are they,--they have their desire;And I with thee one hour will stay,To give thee comfort if I may.\'She heard, but looked not up, nor spake;And sorrow moved him to partakeHer silence; then his thoughts turned round,And fervent words a passage found. \'Gone are they, bravely, though misled;With a dear Father at their head!The Sons obey a natural lord;The Father had given solemn wordTo noble Percy; and a forceStill stronger, bends him to his course.This said, our tears to-day may fallAs at an innocent funeral.In deep and awful channel runsThis sympathy of Sire and Sons; Untried our Brothers have been lovedWith heart by simple nature moved;And now their faithfulness is proved:For faithful we must call them, bearingThat soul of conscientious daring.--There were they all in circle--thereStood Richard, Ambrose, Christopher,John with a sword that will not fail,And Marmaduke in fearless mail,And those bright Twins were side by side; And there, by fresh hopes beautified,Stood He, whose arm yet lacks the powerOf man, our youngest, fairest flower!I, by the right of eldest born,And in a second father\'s place,Presumed to grapple with their scorn,And meet their pity face to face;Yea, trusting in God\'s holy aid,I to my Father knelt and prayed;And one, the pensive Marmaduke, Methought, was yielding inwardly,And would have laid his purpose by,But for a glance of his Father\'s eye,Which I myself could scarcely brook.Then be we, each and all, forgiven!Thou, chiefly thou, my Sister dear,Whose pangs are registered in heaven--The stifled sigh, the hidden tear,And smiles, that dared to take their place,Meek filial smiles, upon thy face, As that unhallowed Banner grewBeneath a loving old Man\'s view.Thy part is done--thy painful part;Be thou then satisfied in heart!A further, though far easier, taskThan thine hath been, my duties ask;With theirs my efforts cannot blend,I cannot for such cause contend;Their aims I utterly forswear;But I in body will be there.

Then, in the turbulence of glee,And in the excess of amity,Says Benjamin, \'That Ass of thine,He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:If he were tethered to the waggon,He\'d drag as well what he is dragging,And we, as brother should with brother,Might trudge it alongside each other!\'Forthwith, obedient to command,The horses made a quiet stand; And to the waggon\'s skirts was tiedThe Creature, by the Mastiff\'s side,The Mastiff wondering, and perplextWith dread of what will happen next;And thinking it but sorry cheer,To have such company so near!This new arrangement made, the WainThrough the still night proceeds again;No Moon hath risen her light to lend;But indistinctly may be kenned The VANGUARD, following close behind,Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!\'Thy wife and child are snug and warm,Thy ship will travel without harm;I like,\' said Benjamin, \'her shape and stature:And this of mine--this bulky creatureOf which I have the steering--this,Seen fairly, is not much amiss!We want your streamers, friend, you know;But, altogether as we go, We make a kind of handsome show!Among these hills, from first to last,We\'ve weathered many a furious blast;Hard passage forcing on, with headAgainst the storm, and canvas spread.I hate a boaster; but to theeWill say\'t, who know\'st both land and sea,The unluckiest hulk that stems the brineIs hardly worse beset than mine,When cross-winds on her quarter beat; And, fairly lifted from my feet,I stagger onward--heaven knows how;But not so pleasantly as now:Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,And many a foundrous pit surrounded!Yet here we are, by night and dayGrinding through rough and smooth our way;Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;And long shall be so yet--God willing!\'\'Ay,\' said the Tar, \'through fair and foul-- But save us from yon screeching owl!\'That instant was begun a frayWhich called their thoughts another way:The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!What must he do but growl and snarl,Still more and more dissatisfiedWith the meek comrade at his side!Till, not incensed though put to proof,The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,Salutes the Mastiff on the head; And so were better manners bred,And all was calmed and quieted.\'Yon screech-owl,\' says the Sailor, turningBack to his former cause of mourning,\'Yon owl!--pray God that all be well!\'Tis worse than any funeral bell;As sure as I\'ve the gift of sight,We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!\'--Said Benjamin, \'This whip shall layA thousand, if they cross our way. I know that Wanton\'s noisy station,I know him and his occupation;The jolly bird hath learned his cheerUpon the banks of Windermere;Where a tribe of them make merry,Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;Hallooing from an open throat,Like travellers shouting for a boat.--The tricks he learned at WindermereThis vagrant owl is playing here-- That is the worst of his employment:He\'s at the top of his enjoyment!\'This explanation stilled the alarm,Cured the foreboder like a charm;This, and the manner, and the voice,Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;His heart is up--he fears no evilFrom life or death, from man or devil;He wheels--and, making many stops,Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops; And, while he talked of blows and scars,Benjamin, among the stars,Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;Such retreating and advancingAs, I ween, was never seenIn bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Mary\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLet other bards of angels sing, Bright suns without a spot; But thou art no such perfect thing: Rejoice that thou art not!

then thus he cried,When I the process have in memory,How thou hast wearied me on every side,Men thence a book might make, a history; What need to seek a conquest over me, Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy Hast thou thy own liege subjects to destroy? Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ireWell hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief.Now mercy, Lord! thou know\'st well I desireThy grace above all pleasures first and chief;And live and die I will in thy belief;For which I ask for guerdon but one boon,That Cresida again thou send me soon.Constrain her heart as quickly to return,As thou dost mine with longing her to see,Then know I well that she would not sojourn. Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not beUnto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee,As Juno was unto the Theban blood,From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.And after this he to the gate did go,Whence Cresid rode, as if in haste she was;And up and down there went, and to and fro,And to himself full oft he said, alas!From hence my hope, and solace forth did pass.O would the blissful God now for his joy, I might her see again coming to Troy!And up to yonder hill was I her guide;Alas, and there I took of her my leave;Yonder I saw her to her Father ride,For very grief of which my heart shall cleave;--And hither home I came when it was eve;And here I dwell an outcast from all joy,And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy.And of himself did he imagine oft,That he was blighted, pale, and waxen less Than he was wont; and that in whispers softMen said, what may it be, can no one guessWhy Troilus hath all this heaviness?All which he of himself conceited whollyOut of his weakness and his melancholy.Another time he took into his head,That every wight, who in the way passed by,Had of him ruth, and fancied that they said,I am right sorry Troilus will die:And thus a day or two drove wearily; As ye have heard; such life \'gan he to leadAs one that standeth betwixt hope and dread.For which it pleased him in his songs to showThe occasion of his woe, as best he might;And made a fitting song, of words but few,Somewhat his woeful heart to make more light;And when he was removed from all men\'s sight,With a soft night voice, he of his Lady dear,That absent was, \'gan sing as ye may hear.O star, of which I lost have all the light, With a sore heart well ought I to bewail,That ever dark in torment, night by night,Toward my death with wind I steer and sail;For which upon the tenth night if thou failWith thy bright beams to guide me but one hour,My ship and me Charybdis will devour.As soon as he this song had thus sung through,He fell again into his sorrows old;And every night, as was his wont to do,Troilus stood the bright moon to behold; And all his trouble to the moon he told,And said; I wis, when thou art horn\'d anew,I shall be glad if all the world be true.Thy horns were old as now upon that morrow,When hence did journey my bright Lady dear,That cause is of my torment and my sorrow;For which, oh, gentle Luna, bright and clear;For love of God, run fast above thy sphere;For when thy horns begin once more to spring,Then shall she come, that with her bliss may bring. The day is more, and longer every nightThan they were wont to be---for he thought so;And that the sun did take his course not right,By longer way than he was wont to go;And said, I am in constant dread I trow,That Phaeton his son is yet alive,His too fond father\'s car amiss to drive.Upon the walls fast also would he walk,To the end that he the Grecian host might see;And ever thus he to himself would talk:-- Lo! yonder is my own bright Lady free;Or yonder is it that the tents must be;And thence does come this air which is so sweet,That in my soul I feel the joy of it.And certainly this wind, that more and moreBy moments thus increaseth in my face,Is of my Lady\'s sighs heavy and sore;I prove it thus; for in no other spaceOf all this town, save only in this place,Feel I a wind, that soundeth so like pain; It saith, Alas, why severed are we twain?A weary while in pain he tosseth thus,Till fully past and gone was the ninth night;And ever at his side stood Pandarus,Who busily made use of all his mightTo comfort him, and make his heart more light;Giving him always hope, that she the morrowOf the tenth day will come, and end his sorrow.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nView From The Top Of Black Comb\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHIS Height a ministering Angel might select:For from the summit of BLACK COMB (dread nameDerived from clouds and storms!) the amplest rangeOf unobstructed prospect may be seenThat British ground commands:--low dusky tracts,Where Trent is nursed, far southward!

All round this pool both flocks and herds might drink On its firm margin, even as from a well, Or some stone-basin which the herdsman\'s hand Had shaped for their refreshment; nor did sun, Or wind from any quarter, ever come, But as a blessing to this calm recess, This glade of water and this one green field. The spot was made by Nature for herself; The travellers know it not, and \'twill remain Unknown to them; but it is beautiful; And if a man should plant his cottage near, Should sleep beneath the shelter of its trees, And blend its waters with his daily meal, He would so love it, that in his death-hour Its image would survive among his thoughts: And therefore, my sweet MARY, this still Nook, With all its beeches, we have named from You!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThose Words Were Uttered As In Pensive Mood\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHOSE words were uttered as in pensive moodWe turned, departing from that solemn sight:A contrast and reproach to gross delight,And life\'s unspiritual pleasures daily wooed!But now upon this thought I cannot brood;It is unstable as a dream of night;Nor will I praise a cloud, however bright,Disparaging Man\'s gifts, and proper food.Grove, isle, with every shape of sky-built dome,Though clad in colours beautiful and pure, Find in the heart of man no natural home:The immortal Mind craves objects that endure:These cleave to it; from these it cannot roam,Nor they from it: their fellowship is secure.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo A Young Lady Who Had Been Reproached For Taking Long Walks In The Country\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDEAR Child of Nature, let them rail!--There is a nest in a green dale,A harbour and a hold;Where thou, a Wife and Friend, shalt seeThy own heart-stirring days, and beA light to young and old.There, healthy as a shepherd boy,And treading among flowers of joyWhich at no season fade,Thou, while thy babes around thee cling, Shalt show us how divine a thingA Woman may be made.Thy thoughts and feelings shall not die,Nor leave thee, when grey hairs are nigh,A melancholy slave;But an old age serene and bright,And lovely as a Lapland night,Shall lead thee to thy grave.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Force Of Prayer, Or, The Founding Of Bolton, A Tradition\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'What is good for a bootless bene?\'With these dark words begins my Tale;And their meaning is, whence can comfort springWhen Prayer is of no avail?\'What is good for a bootless bene?\'The Falconer to the Lady said;And she made answer \'ENDLESS SORROW!\'For she knew that her Son was dead.She knew it by the Falconer\'s words,And from the look of the Falconer\'s eye; And from the love which was in her soulFor her youthful Romilly.--Young Romilly through Barden woodsIs ranging high and low;And holds a greyhound in a leash,To let slip upon buck or doe.The pair have reached that fearful chasm,How tempting to bestride!For lordly Wharf is there pent inWith rocks on either side. This striding-place is called THE STRID,A name which it took of yore:A thousand years hath it borne that name,And shall a thousand more.And hither is young Romilly come,And what may now forbidThat he, perhaps for the hundredth time,Shall bound across THE STRID?He sprang in glee,--for what cared heThat the river was strong, and the rocks were steep?-- But the greyhound in the leash hung back,And checked him in his leap.The Boy is in the arms of Wharf,And strangled by a merciless force;For never more was young Romilly seenTill he rose a lifeless corse.Now there is stillness in the vale,And long, unspeaking, sorrow:Wharf shall be to pitying heartsA name more sad than Yarrow. If for a lover the Lady wept,A solace she might borrowFrom death, and from the passion of death;--Old Wharf might heal her sorrow.She weeps not for the wedding-dayWhich was to be to-morrow:Her hope was a further-looking hope,And hers is a mother\'s sorrow.He was a tree that stood alone,And proudly did its branches wave; And the root of this delightful treeWas in her husband\'s grave!Long, long in darkness did she sit,And her first words were, \'Let there beIn Bolton, on the field of Wharf,A stately Priory!\'The stately Priory was reared;And Wharf, as he moved along,To matins joined a mournful voice,Nor failed at evensong. And the Lady prayed in heavinessThat looked not for relief!But slowly did her succour come,And a patience to her grief.Oh! there is never sorrow of heartThat shall lack a timely end,If but to God we turn, and askOf Him to be our friend!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Horn Of Egremont Castle\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nERE the Brothers through the gatewayIssued forth with old and young,To the Horn Sir Eustace pointedWhich for ages there had hung.Horn it was which none could sound,No one upon living ground,Save He who came as rightful HeirTo Egremont\'s Domains and Castle fair.Heirs from times of earliest recordHad the House of Lucie born, Who of right had held the LordshipClaimed by proof upon the Horn:Each at the appointed hourTried the Horn,--it owned his power;He was acknowledged: and the blast,Which good Sir Eustace sounded, was the last.With his lance Sir Eustace pointed,And to Hubert thus said he,\'What I speak this Horn shall witnessFor thy better memory. Hear, then, and neglect me not!At this time, and on this spot,The words are uttered from my heart,As my last earnest prayer ere we depart.\'On good service we are goingLife to risk by sea and land,In which course if Christ our SaviourDo my sinful soul demand,Hither come thou back straightway,Hubert, if alive that day; Return, and sound the Horn, that weMay have a living House still left in thee!\'\'Fear not,\' quickly answered Hubert;\'As I am thy Father\'s son,What thou askest, noble Brother,With God\'s favour shall be done.\'So were both right well content:Forth they from the Castle went,And at the head of their ArrayTo Palestine the Brothers took their way. Side by side they fought (the LuciesWere a line for valour famed),And where\'er their strokes alighted,There the Saracens were tamed.Whence, then, could it come--the thought--By what evil spirit brought?Oh! can a brave Man wish to takeHis Brother\'s life, for Lands\' and Castle\'s sake?\'Sir!\' the Ruffians said to Hubert,\'Deep he lies in Jordan flood.\' Stricken by this ill assurance,Pale and trembling Hubert stood.\'Take your earnings.\'--Oh! that ICould have \'seen\' my Brother die!It was a pang that vexed him then;And oft returned, again, and yet again.Months passed on, and no Sir Eustace!Nor of him were tidings heard;Wherefore, bold as day, the MurdererBack again to England steered. To his Castle Hubert sped;Nothing has he now to dread.But silent and by stealth he came,And at an hour which nobody could name.None could tell if it were night-time,Night or day, at even or morn;No one\'s eye had seen him enter,No one\'s ear had heard the Horn.But bold Hubert lives in glee:Months and years went smilingly; With plenty was his table spread;And bright the Lady is who shares his bed.Likewise he had sons and daughters;And, as good men do, he sateAt his board by these surrounded,Flourishing in fair estate.And while thus in open dayOnce he sate, as old books say,A blast was uttered from the Horn,Where by the Castle-gate it hung forlorn. \'Tis the breath of good Sir Eustace!He is come to claim his right:Ancient castle, woods, and mountainsHear the challenge with delight.Hubert! though the blast be blownHe is helpless and alone:Thou hast a dungeon, speak the word!And there he may be lodged, and thou be Lord.Speak!--astounded Hubert cannot;And, if power to speak he had, All are daunted, all the householdSmitten to the heart, and sad.\'Tis Sir Eustace; if it beLiving man, it must be he!Thus Hubert thought in his dismay,And by a postern-gate he slunk away.Long, and long was he unheard of:To his Brother then he came,Made confession, asked forgiveness,Asked it by a brother\'s name, And by all the saints in heaven;And of Eustace was forgiven:Then in a convent went to hideHis melancholy head, and there he died.But Sir Eustace, whom good angelsHad preserved from murderers\' hands,And from Pagan chains had rescued,Lived with honour on his lands.Sons he had, saw sons of theirs:And through ages, heirs of heirs, A long posterity renowned,Sounded the Horn which they alone could sound.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Idle Shepherd Boys\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe valley rings with mirth and joy;Among the hills the echoes playA never never ending song,To welcome in the May.The magpie chatters with delight;The mountain raven\'s youngling broodHave left the mother and the nest;And they go rambling east and westIn search of their own food;Or through the glittering vapors dartIn very wantonness of heart.Beneath a rock, upon the grass,Two boys are sitting in the sun;Their work, if any work they have,Is out of mind---or done.On pipes of sycamore they playThe fragments of a Christmas hymn;Or with that plant which in our daleWe call stag-horn, or fox\'s tail,Their rusty hats they trim:And thus, as happy as the day,Those Shepherds wear the time away.Along the river\'s stony margeThe sand-lark chants a joyous song;The thrush is busy in the wood,And carols loud and strong.A thousand lambs are on the rocks,All newly born! both earth and skyKeep jubilee, and more than all,Those boys with their green coronal;They never hear the cry,That plaintive cry! which up the hillComes from the depth of Dungeon-Ghyll.Said Walter, leaping from the ground,\'Down to the stump of yon old yewWe\'ll for our whistles run a race.\'Away the shepherds flew;They leapt---they ran---and when they cameRight opposite to Dungeon-Ghyll,Seeing that he should lose the prize,\'Stop! \' to his comrade Walter cries---James stopped with no good will:Said Walter then, exulting; \'HereYou\'ll find a task for half a year.Cross, if you dare, where I shall cross---Come on, and tread where I shall tread.\'The other took him at his word,And followed as he led.It was a spot which you may seeIf ever you to Langdale go;Into a chasm a mighty blockHath fallen, and made a bridge of rock:The gulf is deep below;And, in a basin black and small,Receives a lofty waterfall.With staff in hand across the cleftThe challenger pursued his march;And now, all eyes and feet, hath gainedThe middle of the arch.When list! he hears a piteous moan---Again !---his heart within him dies---His pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,He totters, pallid as a ghost,And, looking down, espiesA lamb, that in the pool is pentWithin that black and frightful rent.The lamb had slipped into the stream,And safe without a bruise or woundThe cataract had borne him downInto the gulf profound.His dam had seen him when he fell,She saw him down the torrent borne;And, while with all a mother\'s loveShe from the lofty rocks aboveSent forth a cry forlorn,The lamb, still swimming round and round,Made answer to that plaintive sound.When he had learnt what thing it was,That sent this rueful cry; I weenThe Boy recovered heart, and toldThe sight which he had seen.Both gladly now deferred their task;Nor was there wanting other aid---A Poet, one who loves the brooksFar better than the sages\' books,By chance had thither strayed;And there the helpless lamb he foundBy those huge rocks encompassed round.He drew it from the troubled pool,And brought it forth into the light:The Shepherds met him with his charge,An unexpected sight!Into their arms the lamb they took,Whose life and limbs the flood had spared;Then up the steep ascent they hied,And placed him at his mother\'s side;And gently did the BardThose idle Shepherd-Boys upbraid,And bade them better mind their trade.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nUpon The Sight Of A Beautiful Picture Painted By Sir G.

A town of small repute, Among the vine-clad mountains of Auvergne,Was the Youth\'s birth-place. There he wooed a MaidWho heard the heart-felt music of his suitWith answering vows. Plebeian was the stock,Plebeian, though ingenuous, the stock,From which her graces and her honours sprung:And hence the father of the enamoured Youth,With haughty indignation, spurned the thoughtOf such alliance.--From their cradles up,With but a step between their several homes, Twins had they been in pleasure; after strifeAnd petty quarrels, had grown fond again;Each other\'s advocate, each other\'s stay;And, in their happiest moments, not content,If more divided than a sportive pairOf sea-fowl, conscious both that they are hoveringWithin the eddy of a common blast,Or hidden only by the concave depthOf neighbouring billows from each other\'s sight.Thus, not without concurrence of an age Unknown to memory, was an earnest givenBy ready nature for a life of love,For endless constancy, and placid truth;But whatsoe\'er of such rare treasure layReserved, had fate permitted, for supportOf their maturer years, his present mindWas under fascination;--he beheldA vision, and adored the thing he saw.Arabian fiction never filled the worldWith half the wonders that were wrought for him. Earth breathed in one great presence of the spring;Life turned the meanest of her implements,Before his eyes, to price above all gold;The house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine;Her chamber-window did surpass in gloryThe portals of the dawn; all paradiseCould, by the simple opening of a door,Let itself in upon him:--pathways, walks,Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank,Surcharged, within him, overblest to move Beneath a sun that wakes a weary worldTo its dull round of ordinary cares;A man too happy for mortality!So passed the time, till whether through effectOf some unguarded moment that dissolvedVirtuous restraint--ah, speak it, think it, not!Deem rather that the fervent Youth, who sawSo many bars between his present stateAnd the dear haven where he wished to beIn honourable wedlock with his Love, Was in his judgment tempted to declineTo perilous weakness, and entrust his causeTo nature for a happy end of all;Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed,And bear with their transgression, when I addThat Julia, wanting yet the name of wife,Carried about her for a secret griefThe promise of a mother.To concealThe threatened shame, the parents of the MaidFound means to hurry her away by night, And unforewarned, that in some distant spotShe might remain shrouded in privacy,Until the babe was born. When morning cameThe Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss,And all uncertain whither he should turn,Chafed like a wild beast in the toils; but soonDiscovering traces of the fugitives,Their steps he followed to the Maid\'s retreat.Easily may the sequel be divined--Walks to and fro--watchings at every hour; And the fair Captive, who, whene\'er she may,Is busy at her casement as the swallowFluttering its pinions, almost within reach,About the pendent nest, did thus espyHer Lover!--thence a stolen interview,Accomplished under friendly shade of night.I pass the raptures of the pair;--such themeIs, by innumerable poets, touchedIn more delightful verse than skill of mineCould fashion; chiefly by that darling bard Who told of Juliet and her Romeo,And of the lark\'s note heard before its time,And of the streaks that laced the severing cloudsIn the unrelenting east.--Through all her courtsThe vacant city slept; the busy winds,That keep no certain intervals of rest,Moved not; meanwhile the galaxy displayedHer fires, that like mysterious pulses beatAloft;--momentous but uneasy bliss!To their full hearts the universe seemed hung On that brief meeting\'s slender filament!They parted; and the generous VaudracourReached speedily the native threshold, bentOn making (so the Lovers had agreed)A sacrifice of birthright to attainA final portion from his father\'s hand;Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would fleeTo some remote and solitary place,Shady as night, and beautiful as heaven,Where they may live, with no one to behold Their happiness, or to disturb their love.But \'now\' of this no whisper; not the less,If ever an obtrusive word were droppedTouching the matter of his passion, still,In his stern father\'s hearing, VaudracourPersisted openly that death aloneShould abrogate his human privilegeDivine, of swearing everlasting truth,Upon the altar, to the Maid he loved.\'You shall be baffled in your mad intent If there be justice in the court of France,\'Muttered the Father.--From these words the YouthConceived a terror; and, by night or day,Stirred nowhere without weapons, that full soonFound dreadful provocation: for at nightWhen to his chamber he retired, attemptWas made to seize him by three armed men,Acting, in furtherance of the father\'s will,Under a private signet of the State.One the rash Youth\'s ungovernable hand Slew, and as quickly to a second gaveA perilous wound--he shuddered to beholdThe breathless corse; then peacefully resignedHis person to the law, was lodged in prison,And wore the fetters of a criminal.Have you observed a tuft of winged seedThat, from the dandelion\'s naked stalk,Mounted aloft, is suffered not to useIts natural gifts for purposes of rest,Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro Through the wide element? or have you markedThe heavier substance of a leaf-clad bough,Within the vortex of a foaming flood,Tormented? by such aid you may conceiveThe perturbation that ensued;--ah, no!Desperate the Maid--the Youth is stained with blood;Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet!Yet as the troubled seed and tortured boughIs Man, subjected to despotic sway.For him, by private influence with the Court, Was pardon gained, and liberty procured;But not without exaction of a pledge,Which liberty and love dispersed in air.He flew to her from whom they would divide him--He clove to her who could not give him peace--Yea, his first word of greeting was,--\'All rightIs gone from me; my lately-towering hopes,To the least fibre of their lowest root,Are withered; thou no longer canst be mine,I thine--the conscience-stricken must not woo The unruffled Innocent,--I see thy face,Behold thee, and my misery is complete!\'\'One, are we not?\' exclaimed the Maiden--\'One,For innocence and youth, for weal and woe?\'Then with the father\'s name she coupled wordsOf vehement indignation; but the YouthChecked her with filial meekness; for no thoughtUncharitable crossed his mind, no senseOf hasty anger rising in the eclipseOf true domestic loyalty, did e\'er Find place within his bosom.--Once againThe persevering wedge of tyrannyAchieved their separation: and once moreWere they united,--to be yet againDisparted, pitiable lot! But hereA portion of the tale may well be leftIn silence, though my memory could addMuch how the Youth, in scanty space of time,Was traversed from without; much, too, of thoughtsThat occupied his days in solitude Under privation and restraint; and what,Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come,And what, through strong compunction for the past,He suffered--breaking down in heart and mind!Doomed to a third and last captivity,His freedom he recovered on the eveOf Julia\'s travail. When the babe was born,Its presence tempted him to cherish schemesOf future happiness. \'You shall return,Julia,\' said he, \'and to your father\'s house Go with the child.--You have been wretched; yetThe silver shower, whose reckless burthen weighsToo heavily upon the lily\'s head,Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root.Malice, beholding you, will melt away.Go!--\'tis a town where both of us were born;None will reproach you, for our truth is known;And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fateRemain unpitied, pity is not in man.With ornaments--the prettiest, nature yields Or art can fashion, shall you deck our boy,And feed his countenance with your own sweet looksTill no one can resist him.--Now, even now,I see him sporting on the sunny lawn;My father from the window sees him too;Startled, as if some new-created thingEnriched the earth, or Faery of the woodsBounded before him;--but the unweeting ChildShall by his beauty win his grandsire\'s heartSo that it shall be softened, and our loves End happily, as they began!\'These gleamsAppeared but seldom; oftener was he seenPropping a pale and melancholy faceUpon the Mother\'s bosom; resting thusHis head upon one breast, while from the otherThe Babe was drawing in its quiet food.--That pillow is no longer to be thine,Fond Youth! that mournful solace now must passInto the list of things that cannot be!Unwedded Julia, terror-smitten, hears The sentence, by her mother\'s lip pronounced,That dooms her to a convent.--Who shall tell,Who dares report, the tidings to the lordOf her affections? so they blindly askedWho knew not to what quiet depths a weightOf agony had pressed the Sufferer down:The word, by others dreaded, he can hearComposed and silent, without visible signOf even the least emotion. Noting this,When the impatient object of his love Upbraided him with slackness, he returnedNo answer, only took the mother\'s handAnd kissed it; seemingly devoid of pain,Or care, that what so tenderly he pressed,Was a dependant on the obdurate heartOf one who came to disunite their livesFor ever--sad alternative! preferred,By the unbending Parents of the Maid,To secret \'spousals meanly disavowed.--So be it!In the city he remained A season after Julia had withdrawnTo those religious walls. He, too, departs--Who with him?--even the senseless Little-one.With that sole charge he passed the city-gates,For the last time, attendant by the sideOf a close chair, a litter, or sedan,In which the Babe was carried. To a hill,That rose a brief league distant from the town,The dwellers in that house where he had lodgedAccompanied his steps, by anxious love Impelled;--they parted from him there, and stoodWatching below till he had disappearedOn the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took,Throughout that journey, from the vehicle(Slow-moving ark of all his hopes!) that veiledThe tender infant: and, at every inn,And under every hospitable treeAt which the bearers halted or reposed,Laid him with timid care upon his knees,And looked, as mothers ne\'er were known to look, Upon the nursling which his arms embraced.This was the manner in which VaudracourDeparted with his infant; and thus reachedHis father\'s house, where to the innocent childAdmittance was denied. The young man spakeNo word of indignation or reproof,But of his father begged, a last request,That a retreat might be assigned to himWhere in forgotten quiet he might dwell,With such allowance as his wants required; For wishes he had none. To a lodge that stoodDeep in a forest, with leave given, at the ageOf four-and-twenty summers he withdrew;And thither took with him his motherless Babe,And one domestic for their common needs,An aged woman. It consoled him hereTo attend upon the orphan, and performObsequious service to the precious child,Which, after a short time, by some mistakeOr indiscretion of the Father, died.-- The Tale I follow to its last recessOf suffering or of peace, I know not which:Theirs be the blame who caused the woe, not mine!From this time forth he never shared a smileWith mortal creature. An InhabitantOf that same town, in which the pair had leftSo lively a remembrance of their griefs,By chance of business, coming within reachOf his retirement, to the forest lodgeRepaired, but only found the matron there, Who told him that his pains were thrown away,For that her Master never uttered wordTo living thing--not even to her.--Behold!While they were speaking, Vaudracour approached;But, seeing some one near, as on the latchOf the garden-gate his hand was laid, he shrunk--And, like a shadow, glided out of view.Shocked at his savage aspect, from the placeThe visitor retired.Thus lived the YouthCut off from all intelligence with man, And shunning even the light of common day;Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through FranceFull speedily resounded, public hope,Or personal memory of his own deep wrongs,Rouse him: but in those solitary shadesHis days he wasted, an imbecile mind!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe French And The Spanish Guerillas\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHUNGER, and sultry heat, and nipping blastFrom bleak hill-top, and length of march by nightThrough heavy swamp, or over snow-clad height--These hardships ill-sustained, these dangers past,The roving Spanish Bands are reached at last,Charged, and dispersed like foam: but as a flightOf scattered quails by signs do reunite,So these,--and, heard of once again, are chasedWith combinations of long-practised artAnd newly-kindled hope; but they are fled-- Gone are they, viewless as the buried dead:Where now?--Their sword is at the Foeman\'s heart;And thus from year to year his walk they thwart,And hang like dreams around his guilty bed.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo The Daisy (Fourth Poem)\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSweet Flower! belike one day to have A place upon thy Poet\'s grave, I welcome thee once more: But He, who was on land, at sea, My Brother, too, in loving thee, Although he loved more silently, Sleeps by his native shore. Ah! hopeful, hopeful was the day When to that Ship he bent his way, To govern and to guide: His wish was gained: a little time Would bring him back in manhood\'s prime And free for life, these hills to climb; With all his wants supplied. And full of hope day followed day While that stout Ship at anchor lay Beside the shores of Wight; The May had then made all things green; And, floating there, in pomp serene, That Ship was goodly to be seen, His pride and his delight! Yet then, when called ashore, he sought The tender peace of rural thought: In more than happy mood To your abodes, bright daisy Flowers! He then would steal at leisure hours, And loved you glittering in your bowers A starry multitude. But hark the word!--the ship is gone;-- Returns from her long course:--anon Sets sail:--in season due, Once more on English earth they stand: But, when a third time from the land They parted, sorrow was at hand For Him and for his crew. Ill-fated Vessel!--ghastly shock! --At length delivered from the rock, The deep she hath regained; And through the stormy night they steer; Labouring for life, in hope and fear, To reach a safer shore--how near, Yet not to be attained! "Silence!" the brave Commander cried: To that calm word a shriek replied, It was the last death-shriek. --A few (my soul oft sees that sight) Survive upon the tall mast\'s height; But one dear remnant of the night-- For Him in vain I seek. Six weeks beneath the moving sea He lay in slumber quietly; Unforced by wind or wave To quit the Ship for which he died, (All claims of duty satisfied;) And there they found him at her side; And bore him to the grave. Vain service! yet not vainly done For this, if other end were none, That He, who had been cast Upon a way of life unmeet For such a gentle Soul and sweet, Should find an undisturbed retreat Near what he loved, at last-- That neighbourhood of grove and field To Him a resting-place should yield, A meek man and a brave!

Here closed the meditative strain;   But air breathed soft that day,The hoary mountain-heights were cheered,   The sunny vale looked gay;And to the Primrose of the Rock   I gave this after-lay.I sang-Let myriads of bright flowers,   Like Thee, in field and groveRevive unenvied;-mightier far,   Than tremblings that reproveOur vernal tendencies to hope,   Is God\'s redeeming love;That love which changed-for wan disease,   For sorrow that had bentO\'er hopeless dust, for withered age-   Their moral element,And turned the thistles of a curse   To types beneficent.Sin-blighted though we are, we too,   The reasoning Sons of Men,From one oblivious winter called   Shall rise, and breathe again;And in eternal summer lose   Our threescore years and ten.To humbleness of heart descends   This prescience from on high,The faith that elevates the just,   Before and when they die;And makes each soul a separate heaven   A court for Deity.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWhen To The Attractions Of The Busy World\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHEN, to the attractions of the busy world,Preferring studious leisure, I had chosenA habitation in this peaceful Vale,Sharp season followed of continual stormIn deepest winter; and, from week to week,Pathway, and lane, and public road, were cloggedWith frequent showers of snow. Upon a hillAt a short distance from my cottage, standsA stately Fir-grove, whither I was wontTo hasten, for I found, beneath the roof Of that perennial shade, a cloistral placeOf refuge, with an unincumbered floor.Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow,And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth,The redbreast near me hopped; nor was I lothTo sympathise with vulgar coppice birdsThat, for protection from the nipping blast,Hither repaired.--A single beech-tree grewWithin this grove of firs! and, on the forkOf that one beech, appeared a thrush\'s nest; A last year\'s nest, conspicuously builtAt such small elevation from the groundAs gave sure sign that they, who in that houseOf nature and of love had made their homeAmid the fir-trees, all the summer longDwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes,A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock,Would watch my motions with suspicious stare,From the remotest outskirts of the grove,--Some nook where they had made their final stand, Huddling together from two fears--the fearOf me and of the storm. Full many an hourHere did I lose. But in this grove the treesHad been so thickly planted, and had thrivenIn such perplexed and intricate array;That vainly did I seek, beneath their stemsA length of open space, where to and froMy feet might move without concern or care;And, baffled thus, though earth from day to dayWas fettered, and the air by storm disturbed, I ceased the shelter to frequent,--and prized,Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess.The snows dissolved, and genial Spring returnedTo clothe the fields with verdure. Other hauntsMeanwhile were mine; till, one bright April day,By chance retiring from the glare of noonTo this forsaken covert, there I foundA hoary pathway traced between the trees,And winding on with such an easy lineAlong a natural opening, that I stood Much wondering how I could have sought in vainFor what was now so obvious. To abide,For an allotted interval of ease,Under my cottage-roof, had gladly comeFrom the wild sea a cherished Visitant;And with the sight of this same path--begun,Begun and ended, in the shady grove,Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mindThat, to this opportune recess allured,He had surveyed it with a finer eye, A heart more wakeful; and had worn the trackBy pacing here, unwearied and alone,In that habitual restlessness of footThat haunts the Sailor measuring o\'er and o\'erHis short domain upon the vessel\'s deck,While she pursues her course through the dreary sea.When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite\'s pleasant shore,And taken thy first leave of those green hillsAnd rocks that were the play-ground of thy youth,Year followed year, my Brother! and we two, Conversing not, knew little in what mouldEach other\'s mind was fashioned; and at length,When once again we met in Grasmere Vale,Between us there was little other bondThan common feelings of fraternal love.But thou, a Schoolboy, to the sea hadst carriedUndying recollections! Nature thereWas with thee; she, who loved us both, she stillWas with thee; and even so didst thou becomeA \'silent\' Poet; from the solitude Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heartStill couchant, an inevitable ear,And an eye practised like a blind man\'s touch.--Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone;Nor from this vestige of thy musing hoursCould I withhold thy honoured name,--and nowI love the fir-grove with a perfect love.Thither do I withdraw when cloudless sunsShine hot, or wind blows troublesome and strong;And there I sit at evening, when the steep Of Silver-how, and Grasmere\'s peaceful lake,And one green island, gleam between the stemsOf the dark firs, a visionary scene!And, while I gaze upon the spectacleOf clouded splendour, on this dream-like sightOf solemn loveliness, I think on thee,My Brother, and on all which thou hast lost.Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou,Muttering the verses which I muttered firstAmong the mountains, through the midnight watch Art pacing thoughtfully the vessel\'s deckIn some far region, here, while o\'er my head,At every impulse of the moving breeze,The fir-grove murmurs with a sea-like sound,Alone I tread this path;--for aught I know,Timing my steps to thine; and, with a storeOf undistinguishable sympathies,Mingling most earnest wishes for the dayWhen we, and others whom we love, shall meetA second time, in Grasmere\'s happy Vale.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSpanish Guerillas\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHEY seek, are sought; to daily battle led,Shrink not, though far outnumbered by their Foes,For they have learnt to open and to closeThe ridges of grim war; and at their headAre captains such as erst their country bredOr fostered, self-supported chiefs,--like thoseWhom hardy Rome was fearful to oppose;Whose desperate shock the Carthaginian fled.In One who lived unknown a shepherd\'s lifeRedoubted Viriatus breathes again; And Mina, nourished in the studious shade,With that great Leader vies, who, sick of strifeAnd bloodshed, longed in quiet to be laidIn some green island of the western main.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Emigrant Mother\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nONCE in a lonely hamlet I sojournedIn which a Lady driven from France did dwell;The big and lesser griefs with which she mourned,In friendship she to me would often tell.This Lady, dwelling upon British ground,Where she was childless, daily would repairTo a poor neighbouring cottage; as I found,For sake of a young Child whose home was there.Once having seen her clasp with fond embraceThis Child, I chanted to myself a lay,Endeavouring, in our English tongue, to traceSuch things as she unto the Babe might say:And thus, from what I heard and knew, or guessed,My song the workings of her heart expressed.I\'Dear Babe, thou daughter of another,One moment let me be thy mother!An infant\'s face and looks are thine,And sure a mother\'s heart is mine:Thy own dear mother\'s far away,At labour in the harvest field:Thy little sister is at play;--What warmth, what comfort would it yieldTo my poor heart, if thou wouldst beOne little hour a child to me!II\'Across the waters I am come,And I have left a babe at home:A long, long way of land and sea!Come to me--I\'m no enemy:I am the same who at thy sideSate yesterday, and made a nestFor thee, sweet Baby!--thou hast tried,Thou know\'st the pillow of my breast;Good, good art thou:--alas! to meFar more than I can be to thee.III\'Here, little Darling, dost thou lie;An infant thou, a mother I!Mine wilt thou be, thou hast no fears;Mine art thou--spite of these my tears.Alas! before I left the spot,My baby and its dwelling-place;The nurse said to me, \'Tears should notBe shed upon an infant\'s face,It was unlucky\'--no, no, no;No truth is in them who say so!IV\'My own dear Little-one will sigh,Sweet Babe! and they will let him die.\'He pines,\' they\'ll say, \'it is his doom,And you may see his hour is come.\'Oh! had he but thy cheerful smiles,Limbs stout as thine, and lips as gay,Thy looks, thy cunning, and thy wiles,And countenance like a summer\'s day,They would have hopes of him;--and thenI should behold his face again!V\'\'Tis gone--like dreams that we forget;There was a smile or two--yet--yetI can remember them, I seeThe smiles, worth all the world to me.Dear Baby! I must lay thee down;Thou troublest me with strange alarms;Smiles hast thou, bright ones of thy own;I cannot keep thee in my arms;For they confound me;--where--where isThat last, that sweetest smile of his?VI\'Oh! how I love thee!--we will stayTogether here this one half day.My sister\'s child, who bears my name,From France to sheltering England came;She with her mother crossed the sea;The babe and mother near me dwell:Yet does my yearning heart to theeTurn rather, though I love her well:Rest, little Stranger, rest thee here!Never was any child more dear!VII\'--I cannot help it; ill intentI\'ve none, my pretty Innocent!I weep--I know they do thee wrong,These tears---and my poor idle tongue.Oh, what a kiss was that! my cheekHow cold it is! but thou art good;Thine eyes are on me--they would speak,I think, to help me if they could.Blessings upon that soft, warm face,My heart again is in its place!VIII\'While thou art mine, my little Love,This cannot be a sorrowful grove;Contentment, hope, and mother\'s glee,I seem to find them all in thee:Here\'s grass to play with, here are flowers;I\'ll call thee by my darling\'s name;Thou hast, I think, a look of ours,Thy features seem to me the same;His little sister thou shalt be;And, when once more my home I see,I\'ll tell him many tales of Thee.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Fairest, Brightest, Hues Of Ether Fade\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe fairest, brightest, hues of ether fade;The sweetest notes must terminate and die;O Friend! thy flute has breathed a harmonySoftly resounded through this rocky glade;Such strains of rapture as the Genius playedIn his still haunt on Bagdad\'s summit high;He who stood visible to Mirza\'s eye,Never before to human sight betrayed.Lo, in the vale, the mists of evening spread!The visionary Arches are not there, Nor the green Islands, nor the shining Seas:Yet sacred is to me this Mountain\'s head,Whence I have risen, uplifted, on the breezeOf harmony, above all earthly care.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Germans On The Heighs Of Hochheim\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nABRUPTLY paused the strife;--the field throughoutResting upon his arms each warrior stood,Checked in the very act and deed of blood,With breath suspended, like a listening scout.O Silence! thou wert mother of a shoutThat through the texture of yon azure domeCleaves its glad way, a cry of harvest homeUttered to Heaven in ecstasy devout!The barrier Rhine hath flashed, through battle-smoke,On men who gaze heart-smitten by the view, As if all Germany had felt the shock!--Fly, wretched Gauls! ere they the charge renewWho have seen--themselves now casting off the yoke--The unconquerable Stream his course pursue.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Russian Fugitive\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIENOUGH of rose-bud lips, and eyes     Like harebells bathed in dew,Of cheek that with carnation vies,     And veins of violet hue;Earth wants not beauty that may scorn     A likening to frail flowers;Yea, to the stars, if they were born     For seasons and for hours.Through Moscow\'s gates, with gold unbarred,     Stepped One at dead of night,Whom such high beauty could not guard     From meditated blight;By stealth she passed, and fled as fast     As doth the hunted fawn,Nor stopped, till in the dappling east     Appeared unwelcome dawn. Seven days she lurked in brake and field,     Seven nights her course renewed,Sustained by what her scrip might yield,     Or berries of the wood;At length, in darkness travelling on,     When lowly doors were shut,The haven of her hope she won,     Her foster-mother\'s hut.\'To put your love to dangerous proof     I come,\' said she, \'from far;For I have left my Father\'s roof,     In terror of the czar.\'No answer did the Matron give,     No second look she cast,But hung upon the fugitive,     Embracing and embraced.She led the Lady to a seat     Beside the glimmering fire,Bathed duteously her wayworn feet,     Prevented each desire:---The cricket chirped, the house-dog dozed,     And on that simple bed,Where she in childhood had reposed,     Now rests her weary head.When she, whose couch had been the sod,     Whose curtain, pine or thorn,Had breathed a sigh of thanks to God,     Who comforts the forlorn;While over her the Matron bent     Sleep sealed her eyes, and stoleFeeling from limbs with travel spent,     And trouble from the soul.Refreshed, the Wanderer rose at morn,     And soon again was dightIn those unworthy vestments worn     Through long and perilous flight;And \'O beloved Nurse,\' she said,     \'My thanks with silent tearsHave unto Heaven and You been paid:     Now listen to my fears !\'Have you forgot\'---and here she smiled---     \'The babbling flatteriesYou lavished on me when a child     Disporting round your knees?I was your lambkin, and your bird,     Your star, your gem, your flower;Light words, that were more lightly heard     In many a cloudless hour!\'The blossom you so fondly praised     Is come to bitter fruit;A mighty One upon me gazed;     I spurned his lawless suit,And must be hidden from his wrath:     You, Foster-father dear,Will guide me in my forward path;     I may not tarry here! \'I cannot bring to utter woe     Your proved fidelity.\'---\'Dear Child, sweet Mistress, say not so!

And there, sequestered from the eight,     Was spread a treacherous swamp,On which the noonday sun shed light     As from a lonely lamp;And midway in the unsafe morass,     A single Island roseOf firm dry ground, with healthful grass     Adorned, and shady boughs.The Woodman knew, for such the craft     This Russian vassal plied,That never fowler\'s gun, nor shaft     Of archer, there was tried;A sanctuary seemed the spot     From all intrusion free;And there he planned an artful Cot     For perfect secrecy.With earnest pains unchecked by dread     Of Power\'s far-stretching hand,The bold good Man his labor sped     At nature\'s pure command;Heart-soothed, and busy as a wren,     While, in a hollow nook,She moulds her sight-eluding den     Above a murmuring brook.His task accomplished to his mind,     The twain ere break of dayCreep forth, and through the forest wind     Their solitary way; Few words they speak, nor dare to slack     Their pace from mile to mile,Till they have crossed the quaking marsh,     And reached the lonely Isle.The sun above the pine-trees showed     A bright and cheerful face;And Ina looked for her abode,     The promised hiding-place;She sought in vain, the Woodman smiled;     No threshold could be seen,Nor roof, nor window;\\\'97all seemed wild     As it had ever been.Advancing, you might guess an hour,     The front with such nice careIs masked, \'if house it be or bower,\'     But in they entered are;As shaggy as were wall and roof     With branches intertwined,So smooth was all within, air-proof,     And delicately lined:And hearth was there, and maple dish,     And cups in seemly rows,And couch---all ready to a wish     For nurture or repose;And Heaven doth to her virtue grant     That here she may abideIn solitude, with every want     By cautious love supplied. No queen, before a shouting crowd,     Led on in bridal state,E\'er struggled with a heart so proud,     Entering her palace gate:Rejoiced to bid the world farewell,     No saintly anchoressE\'er took possession of her cell     With deeper thankfulness.\'Father of all, upon thy care     And mercy am I thrown;Be thou my safeguard!\'---such her prayer     When she was left alone,Kneeling amid the wilderness     When joy had passed away,And smiles, fond efforts of distress     To hide what they betray!The prayer is heard, the Saints have seen,     Diffused through form and face,Resolves devotedly serene;     That monumental graceOf Faith, which doth all passions tame     That Reason should control;And shows in the untrembling frame     A statue of the soul.III\'TIS sung in ancient minstrelsy     That Phoebus wont to wearThe leaves of any pleasant tree     Around his golden hair;Till Daphne, desperate with pursuit     Of his imperious love,At her own prayer transformed, took root,     A laurel in the grove.Then did the Penitent adorn     His brow with laurel green;And \'mid his bright locks never shorn     No meaner leaf was seen;And poets sage, through every age,     About their temples woundThe bay; and conquerors thanked the Gods,     With laurel chaplets crowned,Into the mists of fabling Time     So far runs back the praiseOf Beauty, that disdains to climb     Along forbidden ways;That scorns temptation; power defies     Where mutual love is not;And to the tomb for rescue flies     When life would be a blot.To this fair Votaress, a fate     More mild doth Heaven ordainUpon her Island desolate;     And word, not breathed in vain,Might tell what intercourse she found,     Her silence to endear;What birds she tamed, what flowers the ground     Sent forth her peace to cheer.To one mute Presence, above all,     Her soothed affections clung,A picture on the cabin wall     By Russian usage hung---The Mother-maid, whose countenance bright     With love abridged the day;And, communed with by taper light,     Chased spectral fears away.And oft as either Guardian came,     The joy in that retreatMight any common friendship shame,     So high their heart would beat;And to the lone Recluse, whate\'er     They brought, each visitingWas like the crowding of the year     With a new burst of spring.But, when she of her Parents thought,     The pang was hard to bear;And, if with all things not enwrought,     That trouble still is near.Before her flight she had not dared     Their constancy to prove,Too much the heroic Daughter feared     The weakness of their love.Dark is the past to them, and dark     The future still must be,Till pitying Saints conduct her bark     Into a safer sea---Or gentle Nature close her eyes,     And set her Spirit freeFrom the altar of this sacrifice,     In vestal purity.Yet, when above the forest-glooms     The white swans southward passed,High as the pitch of their swift plume     Her fancy rode the blast;And bore her toward the fields of France     Her Father\'s native land,To mingle in the rustic dance,      The happiest of the band!Of those beloved fields she oft     Had heard her Father tellIn phrase that now with echoes soft     Haunted her lonely cell;She saw the hereditary bowers,     She heard the ancestral stream;The Kremlin and its haughty towers     Forgotten like a dream !IVTHE ever-changing Moon had traced     Twelve times her monthly round,When through the unfrequented Waste     Was heard a startling sound;A shout thrice sent from one who chased     At speed a wounded deer,Bounding through branches interlaced,     And where the wood was clear.The fainting creature took the marsh,     And toward the Island fled,While plovers screamed with tumult harsh     Above his antlered head;This, Ina saw; and, pale with fear,     Shrunk to her citadel;The desperate deer rushed on, and near     The tangled covert fell.Across the marsh, the game in view,     The Hunter followed fast,Nor paused, till o\'er the stag he blew     A death-proclaiming blast;Then, resting on her upright mind,     Came forth the Maid---\'In meBehold,\' she said, \' a stricken Hind     Pursued by destiny!\'From your deportment, Sir! I deem     That you have worn a sword,And will not hold in light esteem     A suffering woman\'s word;There is my covert, there perchance     I might have lain concealed,My fortunes hid, my countenance     Not even to you revealed.\'Tears might be shed, and I might pray,     Crouching and terrified,That what has been unveiled to day,     You would in mystery hide;But I will not defile with dust     The knee that bend to adoreThe God in heaven;---attend, be just;     This ask I, and no more!\'I speak not of the winter\'s cold,     For summer\'s heat exchanged,While I have lodged in this rough hold,     From social life estranged;Nor yet of trouble and alarms:     High Heaven is my defence;And every season has soft arms     For injured Innocence.\'From Moscow to the Wilderness     It was my choice to come,Lest virtue should be harborless,     And honor want a home;And happy were I, if the Czar     Retain his lawless will,To end life here like this poor deer,     Or a lamb on a green hill.\'\'Are you the Maid,\' the Stranger cried,     \'From Gallic parents sprung,Whose vanishing was rumored wide,     Sad theme for every tongue;Who foiled an Emperor\'s eager quest?

A nun demure of lowly port; Or sprightly maiden, of Love\'s court, In thy simplicity the sport Of all temptations; A queen in crown of rubies drest; A starveling in a scanty vest; Are all, as seems to suit thee best, Thy appellations.

Not with these beganOur song, and not with these our song must end.Ye motions of delight, that haunt the sidesOf the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs, Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,Feelingly watched, might teach Man\'s haughty raceHow without Injury to take, to giveWithout offence; ye who, as if to showThe wondrous influence of power gently used,Bend the complying heads of lordly pines,And, with a touch, shift the stupendous cloudsThrough the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,Muttering along the stones, a busy noiseBy day, a quiet sound in silent night; Ye waves, that out of the great deep steal forthIn a calm hour to kiss the pebbly shore,Not mute, and then retire, fearing no storm;And you, ye groves, whose ministry it isTo interpose the covert of your shades,Even as a sleep, between the heart of manAnd outward troubles, between man himself,Not seldom, and his own uneasy heart:Oh! that I had a music and a voiceHarmonious as your own, that I might tell What ye have done for me. The morning shines,Nor heedeth Man\'s perverseness; Spring returns,--I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,In common with the children of her love,Piping on boughs, or sporting on fresh fields,Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer heavenOn wings that navigate cerulean skies.So neither were complacency, nor peace,Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my goodThrough these distracted times; in Nature still Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,Which, when the spirit of evil reached its height,Maintained for me a secret happiness.This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly toldOf intellectual power, fostering love,Dispensing truth, and, over men and things,Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusingProphetic sympathies of genial faith:So was I favoured--such my happy lot--Until that natural graciousness of mind Gave way to overpressure from the timesAnd their disastrous issues. What availed,When spells forbade the voyager to land,That fragrant notice of a pleasant shoreWafted, at intervals, from many a bowerOf blissful gratitude and fearless love?Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,And hope that future times \'would\' surely see,The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,From him who had been; that I could no more Trust the elevation which had made me oneWith the great family that still survivesTo illuminate the abyss of ages past,Sage, warrior, patriot, hero; for it seemedThat their best virtues were not free from taintOf something false and weak, that could not standThe open eye of Reason. Then I said,\'Go to the Poets, they will speak to theeMore perfectly of purer creatures;--yetIf reason be nobility in man, Can aught be more ignoble than the manWhom they delight in, blinded as he isBy prejudice, the miserable slaveOf low ambition or distempered love?\'In such strange passion, if I may once moreReview the past, I warred against myself--A bigot to a new idolatry--Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,Zealously laboured to cut off my heartFrom all the sources of her former strength; And as, by simple waving of a wand,The wizard instantaneously dissolvesPalace or grove, even so could I unsoulAs readily by syllogistic wordsThose mysteries of being which have made,And shall continue evermore to make,Of the whole human race one brotherhood.What wonder, then, if, to a mind so farPerverted, even the visible UniverseFell under the dominion of a taste Less spiritual, with microscopic viewWas scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?O Soul of Nature! excellent and fair!That didst rejoice with me, with whom I, too,Rejoiced through early youth, before the windsAnd roaring waters, and in lights and shadesThat marched and countermarched about the hillsIn glorious apparition, Powers on whomI daily waited, now all eye and nowAll ear; but never long without the heart Employed, and man\'s unfolding intellect:O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divineSustained and governed, still dost overflowWith an impassioned life, what feeble onesWalk on this earth! how feeble have I beenWhen thou wert in thy strength! Nor this through strokeOf human suffering, such as justifiesRemissness and inaptitude of mind,But through presumption; even in pleasure pleasedUnworthily, disliking here, and there Liking; by rules of mimic art transferredTo things above all art; but more,--for this,Although a strong infection of the age,Was never much my habit--giving wayTo a comparison of scene with scene,Bent overmuch on superficial things,Pampering myself with meagre noveltiesOf colour and proportion; to the moodsOf time and season, to the moral power,The affections and the spirit of the place, Insensible. Nor only did the loveOf sitting thus in judgment interruptMy deeper feelings, but another cause,More subtle and less easily explained,That almost seems inherent in the creature,A twofold frame of body and of mind.I speak in recollection of a timeWhen the bodily eye, in every stage of lifeThe most despotic of our senses, gainedSuch strength in \'me\' as often held my mind In absolute dominion. Gladly here,Entering upon abstruser argument,Could I endeavour to unfold the meansWhich Nature studiously employs to thwartThis tyranny, summons all the senses eachTo counteract the other, and themselves,And makes them all, and the objects with which allAre conversant, subservient in their turnTo the great ends of Liberty and Power.But leave we this: enough that my delights (Such as they were) were sought insatiably.Vivid the transport, vivid though not profound;I roamed from hill to hill, from rock to rock,Still craving combinations of new forms,New pleasure, wider empire for the sight,Proud of her own endowments, and rejoicedTo lay the inner faculties asleep.Amid the turns and counterturns, the strifeAnd various trials of our complex being,As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid,A young enthusiast, who escaped these bonds;Her eye was not the mistress of her heart;Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,Or barren intermeddling subtleties,Perplex her mind; but, wise as women areWhen genial circumstance hath favoured them,She welcomed what was given, and craved no more;Whate\'er the scene presented to her viewThat was the best, to that she was attuned By her benign simplicity of life,And through a perfect happiness of soul,Whose variegated feelings were in thisSisters, that they were each some new delight.Birds in the bower, and lambs in the green field,Could they have known her, would have loved; methoughtHer very presence such a sweetness breathed,That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,And everything she looked on, should have hadAn intimation how she bore herself Towards them and to all creatures. God delightsIn such a being; for, her common thoughtsAre piety, her life is gratitude.Even like this maid, before I was called forthFrom the retirement of my native hills,I loved whate\'er I saw: nor lightly loved,But most intensely; never dreamt of aughtMore grand, more fair, more exquisitely framedThan those few nooks to which my happy feetWere limited. I had not at that time Lived long enough, nor in the least survivedThe first diviner influence of this world,As it appears to unaccustomed eyes.Worshipping them among the depth of things,As piety ordained, could I submitTo measured admiration, or to aughtThat should preclude humility and love?I felt, observed, and pondered; did not judge,Yea, never thought of judging; with the giftOf all this glory filled and satisfied. And afterwards, when through the gorgeous AlpsRoaming, I carried with me the same heart:In truth, the degradation--howsoe\'erInduced, effect, in whatsoe\'er degree,Of custom that prepares a partial scaleIn which the little oft outweighs the great;Or any other cause that hath been named;Or lastly, aggravated by the timesAnd their impassioned sounds, which well might makeThe milder minstrelsies of rural scenes Inaudible--was transient; I had knownToo forcibly, too early in my life,Visitings of imaginative powerFor this to last: I shook the habit offEntirely and for ever, and againIn Nature\'s presence stood, as now I stand,A sensitive being, a \'creative\' soul.There are in our existence spots of time,That with distinct pre-eminence retainA renovating virtue, whence--depressed By false opinion and contentious thought,Or aught of heavier or more deadly weight,In trivial occupations, and the roundOf ordinary intercourse--our mindsAre nourished and invisibly repaired;A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,That penetrates, enables us to mount,When high, more high, and lifts us up when fallen.This efficacious spirit chiefly lurksAmong those passages of life that give Profoundest knowledge to what point, and how,The mind is lord and master--outward senseThe obedient servant of her will. Such momentsAre scattered everywhere, taking their dateFrom our first childhood. I remember well,That once, while yet my inexperienced handCould scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopesI mounted, and we journeyed towards the hills:An ancient servant of my father\'s houseWas with me, my encourager and guide: We had not travelled long, ere some mischanceDisjoined me from my comrade; and, through fearDismounting, down the rough and stony moorI led my horse, and, stumbling on, at lengthCame to a bottom, where in former timesA murderer had been hung in iron chains.The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bonesAnd iron case were gone; but on the turf,Hard by, soon after that fell deed was wrought,Some unknown hand had carved the murderer\'s name. The monumental letters were inscribedIn times long past; but still, from year to yearBy superstition of the neighbourhood,The grass is cleared away, and to this hourThe characters are fresh and visible:A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:Then, reascending the bare common, sawA naked pool that lay beneath the hills,The beacon on the summit, and, more near, A girl, who bore a pitcher on her head,And seemed with difficult steps to force her wayAgainst the blowing wind. It was, in truth,An ordinary sight; but I should needColours and words that are unknown to man,To paint the visionary drearinessWhich, while I looked all round for my lost guide,Invested moorland waste and naked pool,The beacon crowning the lone eminence,The female and her garments vexed and tossed By the strong wind. When, in the blessed hoursOf early love, the loved one at my side,I roamed, in daily presence of this scene,Upon the naked pool and dreary crags,And on the melancholy beacon, fellA spirit of pleasure and youth\'s golden gleam;And think ye not with radiance more sublimeFor these remembrances, and for the powerThey had left behind? So feeling comes in aidOf feeling, and diversity of strength Attends us, if but once we have been strong.Oh! mystery of man, from what a depthProceed thy honours. I am lost, but seeIn simple childhood something of the baseOn which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,That from thyself it comes, that thou must give,Else never canst receive. The days gone byReturn upon me almost from the dawnOf life: the hiding-places of man\'s powerOpen; I would approach them, but they close. I see by glimpses now; when age comes on,May scarcely see at all; and I would give,While yet we may, as far as words can give,Substance and life to what I feel, enshrining,Such is my hope, the spirit of the PastFor future restoration.--Yet anotherOf these memorials:--One Christmas-time,On the glad eve of its dear holidays,Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forthInto the fields, impatient for the sight Of those led palfreys that should bear us home;My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,That, from the meeting-point of two highwaysAscending, overlooked them both, far stretched;Thither, uncertain on which road to fixMy expectation, thither I repaired,Scout-like, and gained the summit; \'twas a dayTempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grassI sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;Upon my right hand couched a single sheep, Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;With those companions at my side, I watchedStraining my eyes intensely, as the mistGave intermitting prospect of the copseAnd plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,--That dreary time,--ere we had been ten daysSojourners in my father\'s house, he died;And I and my three brothers, orphans then,Followed his body to the grave. The event,With all the sorrow that it brought, appeared A chastisement; and when I called to mindThat day so lately past, when from the cragI looked in such anxiety of hope;With trite reflections of morality,Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed lowTo God, Who thus corrected my desires;And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,And all the business of the elements,The single sheep, and the one blasted tree,And the bleak music from that old stone wall, The noise of wood and water, and the mistThat on the line of each of those two roadsAdvanced in such indisputable shapes;All these were kindred spectacles and soundsTo which I oft repaired, and thence would drink,As at a fountain; and on winter nights,Down to this very time, when storm and rainBeat on my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,While in a grove I walk, whose lofty trees,Laden with summer\'s thickest foliage, rock In a strong wind, some working of the spirit,Some inward agitations thence are brought,Whate\'er their office, whether to beguileThoughts over busy in the course they took,Or animate an hour of vacant ease.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSonnet:\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIT is not to be thought of that the FloodOf British freedom, which, to the open seaOf the world\'s praise, from dark antiquityHath flowed, \'with pomp of waters, unwithstood,\'Roused though it be full often to a moodWhich spurns the check of salutary bands,That this most famous Stream in bogs and sandsShould perish; and to evil and to goodBe lost for ever.

Yet Adam prized little the feast and the bowl,--The fields better suited the ease of his soul:He strayed through the fields like an indolent wight,The quiet of nature was Adam\'s delight.For Adam was simple in thought; and the poor,Familiar with him, made an inn of his door:He gave them the best that he had; or, to sayWhat less may mislead you, they took it away.Thus thirty smooth years did he thrive on his farm:The Genius of plenty preserved him from harm: At length, what to most is a season of sorrow,His means are run out,--he must beg, or must borrow.To the neighbours he went,--all were free with their money;For his hive had so long been replenished with honey,That they dreamt not of dearth;--He continued his rounds,Knocked here--and knocked there, pounds still adding to pounds.He paid what he could with his ill-gotten pelf,And something, it might be, reserved for himself:Then (what is too true) without hinting a word,Turned his back on the country--and off like a bird. You lift up your eyes!--but I guess that you frameA judgment too harsh of the sin and the shame;In him it was scarcely a business of art,For this he did all in the \'ease\' of his heart.To London--a sad emigration I ween--With his grey hairs he went from the brook and the green;And there, with small wealth but his legs and his hands,As lonely he stood as a crow on the sands.All trades, as need was, did old Adam assume,--Served as stable-boy, errand-boy, porter, and groom; But nature is gracious, necessity kind,And, in spite of the shame that may lurk in his mind,He seems ten birthdays younger, is green and is stout;Twice as fast as before does his blood run about;You would say that each hair of his beard was alive,And his fingers are busy as bees in a hive.For he\'s not like an Old Man that leisurely goesAbout work that he knows, in a track that he knows;But often his mind is compelled to demur,And you guess that the more then his body must stir. In the throng of the town like a stranger is he,Like one whose own country\'s far over the sea;And Nature, while through the great city he hies,Full ten times a day takes his heart by surprise.This gives him the fancy of one that is young,More of soul in his face than of words on his tongue;Like a maiden of twenty he trembles and sighs,And tears of fifteen will come into his eyes.What\'s a tempest to him, or the dry parching heats?Yet he watches the clouds that pass over the streets; With a look of such earnestness often will stand,You might think he\'d twelve reapers at work in the Strand.Where proud Covent-garden, in desolate hoursOf snow and hoar-frost, spreads her fruits and her flowers,Old Adam will smile at the pains that have madePoor winter look fine in such strange masquerade.\'Mid coaches and chariots, a waggon of straw,Like a magnet, the heart of old Adam can draw;With a thousand soft pictures his memory will teem,And his hearing is touched with the sounds of a dream. Up the Haymarket hill he oft whistles his way,Thrusts his hands in a waggon, and smells at the hay;He thinks of the fields he so often hath mown,And is happy as if the rich freight were his own.But chiefly to Smithfield he loves to repair,--If you pass by at morning, you\'ll meet with him there.The breath of the cows you may see him inhale,And his heart all the while is in Tilsbury Vale.Now farewell, old Adam! when low thou art laid,May one blade of grass spring up over thy head; And I hope that thy grave, wheresoever it be,Will hear the wind sigh through the leaves of a tree.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Dora\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'\'A little onward lend thy guiding handTo these dark steps, a little further on!\'\'--What trick of memory to \'my\' voice hath broughtThis mournful iteration? For though Time,The Conqueror, crowns the Conquered, on this browPlanting his favourite silver diadem,Nor he, nor minister of his--intentTo run before him--hath enrolled me yet,Though not unmenaced, among those who leanUpon a living staff, with borrowed sight. --O my own Dora, my beloved child!Should that day come--but hark! the birds saluteThe cheerful dawn, brightening for me the east;For me, thy natural leader, once againImpatient to conduct thee, not as erstA tottering infant, with compliant stoopFrom flower to flower supported; but to curbThy nymph-like step swift-bounding o\'er the lawn,Along the loose rocks, or the slippery vergeOf foaming torrents.--From thy orisons Come forth; and, while the morning air is yetTransparent as the soul of innocent youth,Let me, thy happy guide, now point thy way,And now precede thee, winding to and fro,Till we by perseverance gain the topOf some smooth ridge, whose brink precipitousKindles intense desire for powers withheldFrom this corporeal frame; whereon who stands,Is seized with strong incitement to push forthHis arms, as swimmers use, and plunge--dread thought, For pastime plunge--into the \'abrupt abyss,\'--Where ravens spread their plumy vans, at ease!And yet more gladly thee would I conductThrough woods and spacious forests,--to beholdThere, how the Original of human art,Heaven-prompted Nature, measures and erectsHer temples, fearless for the stately work,Though waves, to every breeze, its high-arched roof,And storms the pillars rock. But we such schoolsOf reverential awe will chiefly seek In the still summer noon, while beams of light,Reposing here, and in the aisles beyondTraceably gliding through the dusk, recallTo mind the living presences of nuns;A gentle, pensive, white-robed sisterhood,Whose saintly radiance mitigates the gloomOf those terrestrial fabrics, where they serve,To Christ, the Sun of righteousness, espoused.Now also shall the page of classic lore,To these glad eyes from bondage freed, again Lie open; and the book of Holy Writ,Again unfolded, passage clear shall yieldTo heights more glorious still, and into shadesMore awful, where, advancing hand in hand,We may be taught, O Darling of my care!To calm the affections, elevate the soul,And consecrate our lives to truth and love.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMemorials Of A Tour In Scotland, 1803  I. Departure From The Vale Of Grasmere, August 1803\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE gentlest Shade that walked Elysian plainsMight sometimes covet dissoluble chains;Even for the tenants of the zone that liesBeyond the stars, celestial Paradise,Methinks \'twould heighten joy, to overleapAt will the crystal battlements, and peepInto some other region, though less fair,To see how things are made and managed there.Change for the worse might please, incursion boldInto the tracts of darkness and of cold; O\'er Limbo lake with aery flight to steer,And on the verge of Chaos hang in fear.Such animation often do I find,Power in my breast, wings growing in my mind,Then, when some rock or hill is overpast,Perhance without one look behind me cast.Some barrier with which Nature, from the birthOf things, has fenced this fairest spot on earth.O pleasant transit, Grasmere! to resignSuch happy fields, abodes so calm as thine; Not like an outcast with himself at strife;The slave of business, time, or care for life,But moved by choice; or, if constrained in part,Yet still with Nature\'s freedom at the heart;--To cull contentment upon wildest shores,And luxuries extract from bleakest moors;With prompt embrace all beauty to enfold,And having rights in all that we behold.--Then why these lingering steps?--A bright adieu,For a brief absence, proves that love is true; Ne\'er can the way be irksome or forlornThat winds into itself for sweet return.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBook Thirteenth [imagination And Taste, How Impaired And Restored Concluded]\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM Nature doth emotion come, and moodsOf calmness equally are Nature\'s gift:This is her glory; these two attributesAre sister horns that constitute her strength.Hence Genius, born to thrive by interchangeOf peace and excitation, finds in herHis best and purest friend; from her receivesThat energy by which he seeks the truth,From her that happy stillness of the mindWhich fits him to receive it when unsought. Such benefit the humblest intellectsPartake of, each in their degree; \'tis mineTo speak, what I myself have known and felt;Smooth task! for words find easy way, inspiredBy gratitude, and confidence in truth.Long time in search of knowledge did I rangeThe field of human life, in heart and mindBenighted; but, the dawn beginning nowTo re-appear, \'twas proved that not in vainI had been taught to reverence a Power That is the visible quality and shapeAnd image of right reason; that maturesHer processes by steadfast laws; gives birthTo no impatient or fallacious hopes,No heat of passion or excessive zeal,No vain conceits; provokes to no quick turnsOf self-applauding intellect; but trainsTo meekness, and exalts by humble faith;Holds up before the mind intoxicateWith present objects, and the busy dance Of things that pass away, a temperate showOf objects that endure; and by this courseDisposes her, when over-fondly setOn throwing off incumbrances, to seekIn man, and in the frame of social life,Whate\'er there is desirable and goodOf kindred permanence, unchanged in formAnd function, or, through strict vicissitudeOf life and death, revolving. Above allWere re-established now those watchful thoughts Which, seeing little worthy or sublimeIn what the Historian\'s pen so much delightsTo blazon--power and energy detachedFrom moral purpose--early tutored meTo look with feelings of fraternal loveUpon the unassuming things that holdA silent station in this beauteous world.Thus moderated, thus composed, I foundOnce more in Man an object of delight,Of pure imagination, and of love; And, as the horizon of my mind enlarged,Again I took the intellectual eyeFor my instructor, studious more to seeGreat truths, than touch and handle little ones.Knowledge was given accordingly; my trustBecame more firm in feelings that had stoodThe test of such a trial; clearer farMy sense of excellence--of right and wrong:The promise of the present time retiredInto its true proportion; sanguine schemes, Ambitious projects, pleased me less; I soughtFor present good in life\'s familiar face,And built thereon my hopes of good to come.With settling judgments now of what would lastAnd what would disappear; prepared to findPresumption, folly, madness, in the menWho thrust themselves upon the passive worldAs Rulers of the world; to see in these,Even when the public welfare is their aim,Plans without thought, or built on theories Vague and unsound; and having brought the booksOf modern statists to their proper test,Life, human life, with all its sacred claimsOf sex and age, and heaven-descended rights,Mortal, or those beyond the reach of death;And having thus discerned how dire a thingIs worshipped in that idol proudly named\'The Wealth of Nations,\' \'where\' alone that wealthIs lodged, and how increased; and having gainedA more judicious knowledge of the worth And dignity of individual man,No composition of the brain, but manOf whom we read, the man whom we beholdWith our own eyes--I could not but inquire--Not with less interest than heretofore,But greater, though in spirit more subdued--Why is this glorious creature to be foundOne only in ten thousand? What one is,Why may not millions be? What bars are thrownBy Nature in the way of such a hope? Our animal appetites and daily wants,Are these obstructions insurmountable?If not, then others vanish into air.\'Inspect the basis of the social pile:Inquire,\' said I, \'how much of mental powerAnd genuine virtue they possess who liveBy bodily toil, labour exceeding farTheir due proportion, under all the weightOf that injustice which upon ourselvesOurselves entail.\' Such estimate to frame I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)Among the natural abodes of men,Fields with their rural works; recalled to mindMy earliest notices; with these comparedThe observations made in later youth,And to that day continued.--For, the timeHad never been when throes of mighty NationsAnd the world\'s tumult unto me could yield,How far soe\'er transported and possessed,Full measure of content; but still I craved An intermingling of distinct regardsAnd truths of individual sympathyNearer ourselves. Such often might be gleanedFrom the great City, else it must have provedTo me a heart-depressing wilderness;But much was wanting: therefore did I turnTo you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;Sought you enriched with everything I prized,With human kindnesses and simple joys.Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed, Alas! to few in this untoward world,The bliss of walking daily in life\'s primeThrough field or forest with the maid we love,While yet our hearts are young, while yet we breatheNothing but happiness, in some lone nook,Deep vale, or anywhere, the home of both,From which it would be misery to stir:Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,In my esteem, next to such dear delight,Was that of wandering on from day to day Where I could meditate in peace, and cullKnowledge that step by step might lead me onTo wisdom; or, as lightsome as a birdWafted upon the wind from distant lands,Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves,Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn:And, when that pleasant toil had ceased to please,Converse with men, where if we meet a faceWe almost meet a friend, on naked heathsWith long long ways before, by cottage bench, Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.Who doth not love to follow with his eyeThe windings of a public way? the sight,Familiar object as it is, hath wroughtOn my imagination since the mornOf childhood, when a disappearing line,One daily present to my eyes, that crossedThe naked summit of a far-off hillBeyond the limits that my feet had trod,Was like an invitation into space Boundless, or guide into eternity.Yes, something of the grandeur which investsThe mariner, who sails the roaring seaThrough storm and darkness, early in my mindSurrounded, too, the wanderers of the earth;Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more.Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites;From many other uncouth vagrants (passedIn fear) have walked with quicker step; but whyTake note of this? When I began to enquire, To watch and question those I met, and speakWithout reserve to them, the lonely roadsWere open schools in which I daily readWith most delight the passions of mankind,Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;There saw into the depth of human souls,Souls that appear to have no depth at allTo careless eyes. And--now convinced at heartHow little those formalities, to whichWith overweening trust alone we give The name of Education, have to doWith real feeling and just sense; how vainA correspondence with the talking worldProves to the most; and called to make good searchIf man\'s estate, by doom of Nature yokedWith toil, be therefore yoked with ignorance;If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,And intellectual strength so rare a boon--I prized such walks still more, for there I foundHope to my hope, and to my pleasure peace And steadiness, and healing and reposeTo every angry passion. There I heard,From mouths of men obscure and lowly, truthsReplete with honour; sounds in unisonWith loftiest promises of good and fair.There are who think that strong affection, loveKnown by whatever name, is falsely deemedA gift, to use a term which they would use,Of vulgar nature; that its growth requiresRetirement, leisure, language purified By manners studied and elaborate;That whoso feels such passion in its strengthMust live within the very light and airOf courteous usages refined by art.True is it, where oppression worse than deathSalutes the being at his birth, where graceOf culture hath been utterly unknown,And poverty and labour in excessFrom day to day pre-occupy the groundOf the affections, and to Nature\'s self Oppose a deeper nature; there, indeed,Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with easeAmong the close and overcrowded hauntsOf cities, where the human heart is sick,And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.--Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feelHow we mislead each other; above all,How books mislead us, seeking their rewardFrom judgments of the wealthy Few, who seeBy artificial lights; how they debase The Many for the pleasure of those Few;Effeminately level down the truthTo certain general notions, for the sakeOf being understood at once, or elseThrough want of better knowledge in the headsThat framed them; flattering self-conceit with words,That, while they most ambitiously set forthExtrinsic differences, the outward marksWhereby society has parted manFrom man, neglect the universal heart. Here, calling up to mind what then I saw,A youthful traveller, and see daily nowIn the familiar circuit of my home,Here might I pause, and bend in reverenceTo Nature, and the power of human minds,To men as they are men within themselves.How oft high service is performed within,When all the external man is rude in show,--Not like a temple rich with pomp and gold,But a mere mountain chapel, that protects Its simple worshippers from sun and shower.Of these, said I, shall be my song; of these,If future years mature me for the task,Will I record the praises, making verseDeal boldly with substantial things; in truthAnd sanctity of passion, speak of these,That justice may be done, obeisance paidWhere it is due: thus haply shall I teach,Inspire; through unadulterated earsPour rapture, tenderness, and hope,--my theme No other than the very heart of man,As found among the best of those who live--Not unexalted by religious faith,Nor uninformed by books, good books, though few--In Nature\'s presence: thence may I selectSorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight;And miserable love, that is not painTo hear of, for the glory that redoundsTherefrom to human kind, and what we are.Be mine to follow with no timid step Where knowledge leads me: it shall be my prideThat I have dared to tread this holy ground,Speaking no dream, but things oracular;Matter not lightly to be heard by thoseWho to the letter of the outward promiseDo read the invisible soul; by men adroitIn speech, and for communion with the worldAccomplished; minds whose faculties are thenMost active when they are most eloquent,And elevated most when most admired. Men may be found of other mould than these,Who are their own upholders, to themselvesEncouragement, and energy, and will,Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively wordsAs native passion dictates. Others, too,There are among the walks of homely lifeStill higher, men for contemplation framed,Shy, and unpractised in the strife of phrase;Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would sinkBeneath them, summoned to such intercourse: Theirs is the language of the heavens, the power,The thought, the image, and the silent joy:Words are but under-agents in their souls;When they are grasping with their greatest strength,They do not breathe among them: this I speakIn gratitude to God, Who feeds our heartsFor His own service; knoweth, loveth us,When we are unregarded by the world.Also, about this time did I receiveConvictions still more strong than heretofore, Not only that the inner frame is good,And graciously composed, but that, no less,Nature for all conditions wants not powerTo consecrate, if we have eyes to see,The outside of her creatures, and to breatheGrandeur upon the very humblest faceOf human life. I felt that the arrayOf act and circumstance, and visible form,Is mainly to the pleasure of the mindWhat passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms Of Nature have a passion in themselves,That intermingles with those works of manTo which she summons him; although the worksBe mean, have nothing lofty of their own;And that the Genius of the Poet henceMay boldly take his way among mankindWherever Nature leads; that he hath stoodBy Nature\'s side among the men of old,And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!If thou partake the animating faith That Poets, even as Prophets, each with eachConnected in a mighty scheme of truth,Have each his own peculiar faculty,Heaven\'s gift, a sense that fits him to perceiveObjects unseen before, thou wilt not blameThe humblest of this band who dares to hopeThat unto him hath also been vouchsafedAn insight that in some sort he possesses,A privilege whereby a work of his,Proceeding from a source of untaught things, Creative and enduring, may becomeA power like one of Nature\'s. To a hopeNot less ambitious once among the wildsOf Sarum\'s Plain, my youthful spirit was raised;There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downsTrackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roadsLengthening in solitude their dreary line,Time with his retinue of ages fledBackwards, nor checked his flight until I sawOur dim ancestral Past in vision clear; Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there,A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest,With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;The voice of spears was heard, the rattling spearShaken by arms of mighty bone, in strength,Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty.I called on Darkness--but before the wordWas uttered, midnight darkness seemed to takeAll objects from my sight; and lo! againThe Desert visible by dismal flames; It is the sacrificial altar, fedWith living men--how deep the groans! the voiceOf those that crowd the giant wicker thrillsThe monumental hillocks, and the pompIs for both worlds, the living and the dead.At other moments--(for through that wide wasteThree summer days I roamed) where\'er the PlainWas figured o\'er with circles, lines, or mounds,That yet survive, a work, as some divine,Shaped by the Druids, so to represent Their knowledge of the heavens, and image forthThe constellations--gently was I charmedInto a waking dream, a reverieThat, with believing eyes, where\'er I turned,Beheld long-bearded teachers, with white wandsUplifted, pointing to the starry sky,Alternately, and plain below, while breathOf music swayed their motions, and the wasteRejoiced with them and me in those sweet sounds.This for the past, and things that may be viewed Or fancied in the obscurity of yearsFrom monumental hints: and thou, O Friend!Pleased with some unpremeditated strainsThat served those wanderings to beguile, hast saidThat then and there my mind had exercisedUpon the vulgar forms of present things,The actual world of our familiar days,Yet higher power; had caught from them a tone,An image, and a character, by booksNot hitherto reflected. Call we this A partial judgment--and yet why? for \'then\'We were as strangers; and I may not speakThus wrongfully of verse, however rude,Which on thy young imagination, trainedIn the great City, broke like light from far.Moreover, each man\'s Mind is to herselfWitness and judge; and I remember wellThat in life\'s every-day appearancesI seemed about this time to gain clear sightOf a new world--a world, too, that was fit To be transmitted, and to other eyesMade visible; as ruled by those fixed lawsWhence spiritual dignity originates,Which do both give it being and maintainA balance, an ennobling interchangeOf action from without and from within;The excellence, pure function, and best powerBoth of the objects seen, and eye that sees.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSong Of The Spinning Wheel\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFOUNDED UPON A BELIEF PREVALENT AMONG THE PASTORAL VALES OF WESTMORELANDSWIFTLY turn the murmuring wheel!Night has brought the welcome hour,When the weary fingers feelHelp, as if from faery power;Dewy night o\'ershades the ground;Turn the swift wheel round and round!Now, beneath the starry sky,Couch the widely-scattered sheep;--Ply the pleasant labour, ply!For the spindle, while they sleep, Runs with speed more smooth and fine,Gathering up a trustier line.Short-lived likings may be bredBy a glance from fickle eyes;But true love is like the threadWhich the kindly wool supplies,When the flocks are all at restSleeping on the mountain\'s breast.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo A Distant Friend\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWhy art thou silent!

Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much    Unvisited, endeavour\'d to retrace   My life through its first years, and measured back   The way I travell\'d when I first began   To love the woods and fields; the passion yet   Was in its birth, sustain\'d, as might befal,   By nourishment that came unsought, for still,   From week to week, from month to month, we liv\'d   A round of tumult: duly were our games  Prolong\'d in summer till the day-light fail\'d;  No chair remain\'d before the doors, the bench  And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep  The Labourer, and the old Man who had sate,  A later lingerer, yet the revelry  Continued, and the loud uproar: at last,  When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds  Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,  With weary joints, and with a beating mind.  Ah! is there one who ever has been young,  Nor needs a monitory voice to tame  The pride of virtue, and of intellect?  And is there one, the wisest and the best  Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish  For things which cannot be, who would not give,  If so he might, to duty and to truth  The eagerness of infantine desire?  A tranquillizing spirit presses now  On my corporeal frame: so wide appears  The vacancy between me and those days,  Which yet have such self-presence in my mind  That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem  Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself  And of some other Being. A grey Stone  Of native rock, left midway in the Square  Of our small market Village, was the home  And centre of these joys, and when, return\'d  After long absence, thither I repair\'d,  I found that it was split, and gone to build  A smart Assembly-room that perk\'d and flar\'d  With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground  Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream,  And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know  That more than one of you will think with me  Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame  From whom the stone was nam\'d who there had sate  And watch\'d her Table with its huckster\'s wares  Assiduous, thro\' the length of sixty years.      We ran a boisterous race; the year span round  With giddy motion. But the time approach\'d  That brought with it a regular desire  For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms  Of Nature were collaterally attach\'d  To every scheme of holiday delight,  And every boyish sport, less grateful else,  And languidly pursued.         When summer came  It was the pastime of our afternoons  To beat along the plain of Windermere  With rival oars, and the selected bourne  Was now an Island musical with birds  That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle  Beneath the oaks\' umbrageous covert, sown  With lillies of the valley, like a field;  And now a third small Island where remain\'d  An old stone Table, and a moulder\'d Cave,  A Hermit\'s history. In such a race,  So ended, disappointment could be none,  Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:  We rested in the shade, all pleas\'d alike,  Conquer\'d and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,  And the vain-glory of superior skill  Were interfus\'d with objects which subdu\'d  And temper\'d them, and gradually produc\'d  A quiet independence of the heart.  And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add,  Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence  Ensu\'d a diffidence and modesty,  And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,  The self-sufficing power of solitude.      No delicate viands sapp\'d our bodily strength;  More than we wish\'d we knew the blessing then  Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals  Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude  A little weekly stipend, and we lived  Through three divisions of the quarter\'d year  In pennyless poverty. But now, to School  Return\'d, from the half-yearly holidays,  We came with purses more profusely fill\'d,  Allowance which abundantly suffic\'d  To gratify the palate with repasts  More costly than the Dame of whom I spake,  That ancient Woman, and her board supplied.  Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long  Excursions far away among the hills,  Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,  Or in the woods, or near a river side,  Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs  Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun  Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy.    Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell How twice in the long length of those half-years We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least, To feel the motion of the galloping Steed; And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth, On such occasion sometimes we employ\'d Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound Of the day\'s journey was too distant far For any cautious man, a Structure famed Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls Of that large Abbey which within the vale Of Nightshade, to St. Mary\'s honour built, Stands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch, Belfry, and Images, and living Trees, A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace Left by the sea wind passing overhead (Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers May in that Valley oftentimes be seen, Both silent and both motionless alike; Such is the shelter that is there, and such The safeguard for repose and quietness.    Our steeds remounted, and the summons given, With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg\'d Knight, And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers The earth was comfortless, and, touch\'d by faint Internal breezes, sobbings of the place, And respirations, from the roofless walls The shuddering ivy dripp\'d large drops, yet still, So sweetly \'mid the gloom the invisible Bird Sang to itself, that there I could have made My dwelling-place, and liv\'d for ever there To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew And down the valley, and a circuit made In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth We scamper\'d homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams, And that still Spirit of the evening air! Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt Your presence, when with slacken\'d step we breath\'d Along the sides of the steep hills, or when, Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea, We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.    Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere, Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay, There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed, Brother of the surrounding Cottages, But \'twas a splendid place, the door beset With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine. In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built On the large Island, had this Dwelling been More worthy of a Poet\'s love, a Hut, Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade. But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed The threshold, and large golden characters On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp\'d The place of the old Lion, in contempt And mockery of the rustic painter\'s hand, Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay Upon a slope surmounted by the plain Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood A grove; with gleams of water through the trees And over the tree-tops; nor did we want Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream. And there, through half an afternoon, we play\'d On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall Of night, when in our pinnace we return\'d Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach Of some small Island steer\'d our course with one, The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there, And row\'d off gently, while he blew his flute Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm And dead still water lay upon my mind Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky Never before so beautiful, sank down Into my heart, and held me like a dream.    Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged, And thus the common range of visible things Grew dear to me: already I began To love the sun, a Boy I lov\'d the sun, Not as I since have lov\'d him, as a pledge And surety of our earthly life, a light Which while we view we feel we are alive; But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay His beauty on the morning hills, had seen The western mountain touch his setting orb, In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess Of happiness, my blood appear\'d to flow With its own pleasure, and I breath\'d with joy. And from like feelings, humble though intense, To patriotic and domestic love Analogous, the moon to me was dear; For I would dream away my purposes, Standing to look upon her while she hung Midway between the hills, as if she knew No other region; but belong\'d to thee, Yea, appertain\'d by a peculiar right To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale!    Those incidental charms which first attach\'d My heart to rural objects, day by day Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell How Nature, intervenient till this time, And secondary, now at length was sought For her own sake. But who shall parcel out His intellect, by geometric rules, Split, like a province, into round and square? Who knows the individual hour in which His habits were first sown, even as a seed, Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say, \'This portion of the river of my mind Came from yon fountain?\' Thou, my Friend! art one More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee Science appears but, what in truth she is, Not as our glory and our absolute boast, But as a succedaneum, and a prop To our infirmity. Thou art no slave Of that false secondary power, by which, In weakness, we create distinctions, then Deem that our puny boundaries are things Which we perceive, and not which we have made. To thee, unblinded by these outward shows, The unity of all has been reveal\'d And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill\'d Than many are to class the cabinet Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase, Run through the history and birth of each, As of a single independent thing. Hard task to analyse a soul, in which, Not only general habits and desires, But each most obvious and particular thought, Not in a mystical and idle sense, But in the words of reason deeply weigh\'d, Hath no beginning.          Bless\'d the infant Babe, (For with my best conjectures I would trace The progress of our Being) blest the Babe, Nurs\'d in his Mother\'s arms, the Babe who sleeps Upon his Mother\'s breast, who, when his soul Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul, Doth gather passion from his Mother\'s eye! Such feelings pass into his torpid life Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind Even [in the first trial of its powers] Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine In one appearance, all the elements And parts of the same object, else detach\'d And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day, Subjected to the discipline of love, His organs and recipient faculties Are quicken\'d, are more vigorous, his mind spreads, Tenacious of the forms which it receives. In one beloved presence, nay and more, In that most apprehensive habitude And those sensations which have been deriv\'d From this beloved Presence, there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts All objects through all intercourse of sense. No outcast he, bewilder\'d and depress\'d; Along his infant veins are interfus\'d The gravitation and the filial bond Of nature, that connect him with the world. Emphatically such a Being lives, An inmate of this  active universe; From nature largely he receives; nor so Is satisfied, but largely gives again, For feeling has to him imparted strength, And powerful in all sentiments of grief, Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind, Even as an agent of the one great mind, Creates, creator and receiver both, Working but in alliance with the works Which it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first Poetic spirit of our human life; By uniform control of after years In most abated or suppress\'d, in some, Through every change of growth or of decay, Pre-eminent till death.       From early days, Beginning not long after that first time In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch, I held mute dialogues with my Mother\'s heart I have endeavour\'d to display the means Whereby this infant sensibility, Great birthright of our Being, was in me Augmented and sustain\'d. Yet is a path More difficult before me, and I fear That in its broken windings we shall need The chamois\' sinews, and the eagle\'s wing: For now a trouble came into my mind From unknown causes. I was left alone, Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why. The props of my affections were remov\'d, And yet the building stood, as if sustain\'d By its own spirit! All that I beheld Was dear to me, and from this cause it came, That now to Nature\'s finer influxes My mind lay open, to that more exact And intimate communion which our hearts Maintain with the minuter properties Of objects which already are belov\'d, And of those only. Many are the joys Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live When every hour brings palpable access Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight, And sorrow is not there. The seasons came, And every season to my notice brought A store of transitory qualities Which, but for this most watchful power of love Had been neglected, left a register Of permanent relations, else unknown, Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude More active, even, than \'best society\', Society made sweet as solitude By silent inobtrusive sympathies, And gentle agitations of the mind From manifold distinctions, difference Perceived in things, where to the common eye, No difference is; and hence, from the same source Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone, In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time, Have felt whate\'er there is of power in sound To breathe an elevated mood, by form Or image unprofaned; and I would stand, Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are The ghostly language of the ancient earth, Or make their dim abode in distant winds. Thence did I drink the visionary power. I deem not profitless those fleeting moods Of shadowy exultation: not for this, That they are kindred to our purer mind And intellectual life; but that the soul, Remembering how she felt, but what she felt Remembering not, retains an obscure sense Of possible sublimity, to which, With growing faculties she doth aspire, With faculties still growing, feeling still That whatsoever point they gain, they still Have something to pursue.       And not alone, In grandeur and in tumult, but no less In tranquil scenes, that universal power And fitness in the latent qualities And essences of things, by which the mind Is mov\'d by feelings of delight, to me Came strengthen\'d with a superadded soul, A virtue not its own. My morning walks Were early; oft, before the hours of School I travell\'d round our little Lake, five miles Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear For this, that one was by my side, a Friend Then passionately lov\'d; with heart how full Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps A blank to other men! for many years Have since flow\'d in between us; and our minds, Both silent to each other, at this time We live as if those hours had never been. Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush Was audible, among the hills I sate Alone, upon some jutting eminence At the first hour of morning, when the Vale Lay quiet in an utter solitude. How shall I trace the history, where seek The origin of what I then have felt? Oft in these moments such a holy calm Did overspread my soul, that I forgot That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw Appear\'d like something in myself, a dream, A prospect in my mind.       \'Twere long to tell What spring and autumn, what the winter snows, And what the summer shade, what day and night, The evening and the morning, what my dreams And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse That spirit of religious love in which I walked with Nature. But let this, at least Be not forgotten, that I still retain\'d My first creative sensibility, That by the regular action of the world My soul was unsubdu\'d. A plastic power Abode with me, a forming hand, at times Rebellious, acting in a devious mood, A local spirit of its own, at war With general tendency, but for the most Subservient strictly to the external things With which it commun\'d. An auxiliar light Came from my mind which on the setting sun Bestow\'d new splendor, the melodious birds, The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on, Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey\'d A like dominion; and the midnight storm Grew darker in the presence of my eye. Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence, And hence my transport.       Nor should this, perchance, Pass unrecorded, that I still have lov\'d The exercise and produce of a toil Than analytic industry to me More pleasing, and whose character I deem Is more poetic as resembling more Creative agency. I mean to speak Of that interminable building rear\'d By observation of affinities In objects where no brotherhood exists To common minds. My seventeenth year was come And, whether from this habit, rooted now So deeply in my mind, or from excess Of the great social principle of life, Coercing all things into sympathy, To unorganic natures I transferr\'d My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth Coming in revelation, I convers\'d With things that really are, I, at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. Thus did my days pass on, and now at length From Nature and her overflowing soul I had receiv\'d so much that all my thoughts Were steep\'d in feeling; I was only then Contented when with bliss ineffable I felt the sentiment of Being spread O\'er all that moves, and all that seemeth still, O\'er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought And human knowledge, to the human eye Invisible, yet liveth to the heart, O\'er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings, Or beats the gladsome air, o\'er all that glides Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not If such my transports were; for in all things I saw one life, and felt that it was joy. One song they sang, and it was audible, Most audible then when the fleshly ear, O\'ercome by grosser prelude of that strain, Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb\'d.    If this be error, and another faith Find easier access to the pious mind, Yet were I grossly destitute of all Those human sentiments which make this earth So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes, And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds That dwell among the hills where I was born. If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart, If, mingling with the world, I am content With my own modest pleasures, and have liv\'d, With God and Nature communing, remov\'d From little enmities and low desires, The gift is yours; if in these times of fear, This melancholy waste of hopes o\'erthrown, If, \'mid indifference and apathy And wicked exultation, when good men, On every side fall off we know not how, To selfishness, disguis\'d in gentle names Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love, Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers On visionary minds; if in this time Of dereliction and dismay, I yet Despair not of our nature; but retain A more than Roman confidence, a faith That fails not, in all sorrow my support, The blessing of my life, the gift is yours, Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed My lofty speculations; and in thee, For this uneasy heart of ours I find A never-failing principle of joy, And purest passion.       Thou, my Friend! wert rear\'d In the great City, \'mid far other scenes; But we, by different roads at length have gain\'d The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee I speak, unapprehensive of contempt, The insinuated scoff of coward tongues, And all that silent language which so oft In conversation betwixt man and man Blots from the human countenance all trace Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought The truth in solitude, and Thou art one, The most intense of Nature\'s worshippers In many things my Brother, chiefly here In this my deep devotion.       Fare Thee well! Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men, And yet more often living with Thyself, And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days Be many, and a blessing to mankind.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Eagle And The Dove\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSHADE of Caractacus, if spirits loveThe cause they fought for in their earthly homeTo see the Eagle ruffled by the DoveMay soothe thy memory of the chains of Rome.These children claim thee for their sire; the breathOf thy renown, from Cambrian mountains, fansA flame within them that despises deathAnd glorifies the truant youth of Vannes.With thy own scorn of tyrants they advance,But truth divine has sanctified their rage, A silver cross enchased with flowers of FranceTheir badge, attests the holy fight they wage.The shrill defiance of the young crusadeTheir veteran foes mock as an idle noise;But unto Faith and Loyalty comes aidFrom Heaven, gigantic force to beardless boys.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo The Daisy\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIN youth from rock to rock I wentFrom hill to hill in discontentOf pleasure high and turbulent,       Most pleased when most uneasy;But now my own delights I make,---Thirst at every rill can slake,And gladly Nature\'s love partake,       Of Thee, sweet Daisy!Thee Winter in the garland wearsThat thinly decks his few gray hairs;Spring parts the clouds with softest airs,       That she may sun thee;Whole Summer-fields are thine by right;And Autumn, melancholy Wight!Doth in thy crimson head delight       When rains are on thee.In shoals and bands, a morrice train,Thou greet\'st the traveller in the lane;Pleased at his greeting thee again;       Yet nothing daunted,Nor grieved if thou be set at nought:And oft alone in nooks remoteWe meet thee, like a pleasant thought,       When such are wanted.Be violets in their secret mewsThe flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose;Proud be the rose, with rains and dew       Her head impearling,Thou liv\'st with less ambitious aim,Yet hast not gone without thy fame;Thou art indeed by many a claim       The Poet\'s darling.If to a rock from rain he fly,Or, some bright day of April sky,Imprisoned by hot sunshine lie       Near the green holly,And wearily at length should fare;He need but look about, and thereThou art!---a friend at hand, to care       His melancholy.A hundred times, by rock or bower,Ere thus I have lain couched an hour,Have I derived from thy sweet power       Some apprehensionSome steady love; some brief delight;Some memory that had taken flight;Some chime of fancy wrong or right;       Of stray invention.If stately passions in me burn,And one chance look to Thee should turn,I drink out of an humbler urn       A lowlier pleasure;The homely sympathy that heedsThe common life, our nature breeds;A wisdom fitted to the needsOf hearts at leisure.Fresh-smitten by the morning ray,When thou art up, alert and gay,Then, cheerful Flower! my spirits play       With kindred gladness:And when, at dusk, by dews opprestThou sink\'st, the image of thy restHath often eased my pensive breast       Of careful sadness.And all day long I number yet,All seasons through, another debt,       Which I, wherever thou art met,To thee am owing;An instinct call it, a blind sense;A happy, genial influence,Coming one knows not how, nor whence,       Nor whither going.Child of the Year! that round dost runThy pleasant course,---when day\'s begunAs ready to salute the sun       As lark or leveret,Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain;Nor be less dear to future menThan in old time;---thou not in vain       Art Nature\'s favourite.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Sailor\'s Mother\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nONE morning (raw it was and wet---    A foggy day in winter time)    A Woman on the road I met,    Not old, though something past her prime:    Majestic in her person, tall and straight;And like a Roman matron\'s was her mien and gait.    The ancient spirit is not dead;    Old times, thought I, are breathing there;    Proud was I that my country bred    Such strength, a dignity so fair:    She begged an alms, like one in poor estate;I looked at her again, nor did my pride abate.    When from these lofty thoughts I woke,    \'What is it,\' said I, \'that you bear,    Beneath the covert of your Cloak,    Protected from this cold damp air? \'    She anwered, soon as she the question heard,\'A simple burthen, Sir, a little Singing-bird.\'    And, thus continuing, she said,    \'I had a Son, who many a day    Sailed on the seas, but he is dead;    In Denmark he was cast away:    And I have travelled weary miles to seeIf aught which he had owned might still remain for me.    The bird and cage they both were his:    \'Twas my Son\'s bird; and neat and trim    He kept it: many voyages    The singing-bird had gone with him;    When last he sailed, he left the bird behind;From bodings, as might be, that hung upon his mind.    He to a fellow-lodger\'s care    Had left it, to be watched and fed,    And pipe its song in safety;---there    I found it when my Son was dead;    And now, God help me for my little wit!I bear it with me, Sir;---he took so much delight in it.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWritten In A Blank Leaf Of Macpherson\'s Ossian\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOFT have I caught, upon a fitful breeze,Fragments of far-off melodies,With ear not coveting the whole,A part so charmed the pensive soul.While a dark storm before my sightWas yielding, on a mountain heightLoose vapours have I watched, that wonPrismatic colours from the sun;Nor felt a wish that heaven would showThe image of its perfect bow.

The passion yetWas in its birth, sustained as might befallBy nourishment that came unsought; for stillFrom week to week, from month to month, we livedA round of tumult. Duly were our gamesProlonged in summer till the daylight failed: No chair remained before the doors; the benchAnd threshold steps were empty; fast asleepThe labourer, and the old man who had sateA later lingerer; yet the revelryContinued and the loud uproar: at last,When all the ground was dark, and twinkling starsEdged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.Ah! is there one who ever has been young,Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride Of intellect and virtue\'s self-esteem?One is there, though the wisest and the bestOf all mankind, who covets not at timesUnion that cannot be;--who would not giveIf so he might, to duty and to truthThe eagerness of infantine desire?A tranquillising spirit presses nowOn my corporeal frame, so wide appearsThe vacancy between me and those daysWhich yet have such self-presence in my mind, That, musing on them, often do I seemTwo consciousnesses, conscious of myselfAnd of some other Being. A rude massOf native rock, left midway in the squareOf our small market village, was the goalOr centre of these sports; and when, returnedAfter long absence, thither I repaired,Gone was the old grey stone, and in its placeA smart Assembly-room usurped the groundThat had been ours. There let the fiddle scream, And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I knowThat more than one of you will think with meOf those soft starry nights, and that old DameFrom whom the stone was named, who there had sate,And watched her table with its huckster\'s waresAssiduous, through the length of sixty years.We ran a boisterous course; the year span roundWith giddy motion. But the time approachedThat brought with it a regular desireFor calmer pleasures, when the winning forms Of Nature were collaterally attachedTo every scheme of holiday delightAnd every boyish sport, less grateful elseAnd languidly pursued.When summer came,Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,To sweep along the plain of WindermereWith rival oars; and the selected bourneWas now an Island musical with birdsThat sang and ceased not; now a Sister IsleBeneath the oaks\' umbrageous covert, sown With lilies of the valley like a field;And now a third small Island, where survivedIn solitude the ruins of a shrineOnce to Our Lady dedicate, and servedDaily with chaunted rites. In such a raceSo ended, disappointment could be none,Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,And the vain-glory of superior skill, Were tempered; thus was gradually producedA quiet independence of the heart;And to my Friend who knows me I may add,Fearless of blame, that hence for future daysEnsued a diffidence and modesty,And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,The self-sufficing power of Solitude.Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!More than we wished we knew the blessing thenOf vigorous hunger--hence corporeal strength Unsapped by delicate viands; for, excludeA little weekly stipend, and we livedThrough three divisions of the quartered yearIn penniless poverty. But now to schoolFrom the half-yearly holidays returned,We came with weightier purses, that sufficedTo furnish treats more costly than the DameOf the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,Or in the woods, or by a river side Or shady fountains, while among the leavesSoft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sunUnfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.Nor is my aim neglected if I tellHow sometimes, in the length of those half-years,We from our funds drew largely;--proud to curb,And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose studSupplied our want, we haply might employSly subterfuge, if the adventure\'s bound Were distant: some famed temple where of yoreThe Druids worshipped, or the antique wallsOf that large abbey, where within the ValeOf Nightshade, to St. Mary\'s honour built,Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,Belfry, and images, and living trees;A holy scene!--Along the smooth green turfOur horses grazed. To more than inland peace,Left by the west wind sweeping overheadFrom a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers In that sequestered valley may be seen,Both silent and both motionless alike;Such the deep shelter that is there, and suchThe safeguard for repose and quietness.Our steeds remounted and the summons given,With whip and spur we through the chauntry flewIn uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,And the stone-abbot, and that single wrenWhich one day sang so sweetly in the naveOf the old church, that--though from recent showers The earth was comfortless, and, touched by faintInternal breezes, sobbings of the placeAnd respirations, from the roofless wallsThe shuddering ivy dripped large drops--yet stillSo sweetly \'mid the gloom the invisible birdSang to herself, that there I could have madeMy dwelling-place, and lived for ever thereTo hear such music. Through the walls we flewAnd down the valley, and, a circuit madeIn wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,And that still spirit shed from evening air!Even in this joyous time I sometimes feltYour presence, when with slackened step we breathedAlong the sides of the steep hills, or whenLighted by gleams of moonlight from the seaWe beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.Midway on long Winander\'s eastern shore,Within the crescent of pleasant bay,A tavern stood; no homely-featured house, Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,But \'twas a splendid place, the door besetWith chaises, grooms, and liveries, and withinDecanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine.In ancient times, and ere the Hall was builtOn the large island, had this dwelling beenMore worthy of a poet\'s love, a hut,Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.But--though the rhymes were gone that once inscribedThe threshold, and large golden characters, Spread o\'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodgedThe old Lion and usurped his place, in slightAnd mockery of the rustic painter\'s hand--Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dearWith all its foolish pomp. The garden layUpon a slope surmounted by a plainOf a small bowling-green; beneath us stoodA grove, with gleams of water through the treesAnd over the tree-tops; nor did we wantRefreshment, strawberries and mellow cream. There, while through half an afternoon we playedOn the smooth platform, whether skill prevailedOr happy blunder triumphed, bursts of gleeMade all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,When in our pinnace we returned at leisureOver the shadowy lake, and to the beachOf some small island steered our course with one,The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there,And rowed off gently, while he blew his fluteAlone upon the rock--oh, then, the calm And dead still water lay upon my mindEven with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,Never before so beautiful, sank downInto my heart, and held me like a dream!Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thusDaily the common range of visible thingsGrew dear to me: already I beganTo love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,Not as I since have loved him, as a pledgeAnd surety of our earthly life, a light Which we behold and feel we are alive;Nor for his bounty to so many worlds--But for this cause, that I had seen him layHis beauty on the morning hills, had seenThe western mountain touch his setting orb,In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excessOf happiness, my blood appeared to flowFor its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy.And, from like feelings, humble though intense,To patriotic and domestic love Analogous, the moon to me was dear;For I could dream away my purposes,Standing to gaze upon her while she hungMidway between the hills, as if she knewNo other region, but belonged to thee,Yea, appertained by a peculiar rightTo thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale!Those incidental charms which first attachedMy heart to rural objects, day by dayGrew weaker, and I hasten on to tell How Nature, intervenient till this timeAnd secondary, now at length was soughtFor her own sake. But who shall parcel outHis intellect by geometric rules,Split like a province into round and square?Who knows the individual hour in whichHis habits were first sown, even as a seed?Who that shall point as with a wand and say\'This portion of the river of my mindCame from yon fountain?\' Thou, my Friend! art one More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to theeScience appears but what in truth she is,Not as our glory and our absolute boast,But as a succedaneum, and a propTo our infirmity. No officious slaveArt thou of that false secondary powerBy which we multiply distinctions, thenDeem that our puny boundaries are thingsThat we perceive, and not that we have made.To thee, unblinded by these formal arts, The unity of all hath been revealed,And thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilledThan many are to range the facultiesIn scale and order, class the cabinetOf their sensations, and in voluble phraseRun through the history and birth of eachAs of a single independent thing.Hard task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,If each most obvious and particular thought,Not in a mystical and idle sense, But in the words of Reason deeply weighed,Hath no beginning.Blest the infant Babe,(For with my best conjecture I would traceOur Being\'s earthly progress,) blest the Babe,Nursed in his Mother\'s arms, who sinks to sleepRocked on his Mother\'s breast; who with his soulDrinks in the feelings of his Mother\'s eye!For him, in one dear Presence, there existsA virtue which irradiates and exaltsObjects through widest intercourse of sense. No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:Along his infant veins are interfusedThe gravitation and the filial bondOf nature that connect him with the world.Is there a flower, to which he points with handToo weak to gather it, already loveDrawn from love\'s purest earthly fount for himHath beautified that flower; already shadesOf pity cast from inward tendernessDo fall around him upon aught that bears Unsightly marks of violence or harm.Emphatically such a Being lives,Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,An inmate of this active universe:For, feeling has to him imparted powerThat through the growing faculties of senseDoth like an agent of the one great MindCreate, creator and receiver both,Working but in alliance with the worksWhich it beholds.--Such, verily, is the first Poetic spirit of our human life,By uniform control of after years,In most, abated or suppressed; in some,Through every change of growth and of decay,Pre-eminent till death.From early days,Beginning not long after that first timeIn which, a Babe, by intercourse of touchI held mute dialogues with my Mother\'s heart,I have endeavoured to display the meansWhereby this infant sensibility, Great birthright of our being, was in meAugmented and sustained. Yet is a pathMore difficult before me; and I fearThat in its broken windings we shall needThe chamois\' sinews, and the eagle\'s wing:For now a trouble came into my mindFrom unknown causes. I was left aloneSeeking the visible world, nor knowing why.The props of my affections were removed,And yet the building stood, as if sustained By its own spirit! All that I beheldWas dear, and hence to finer influxesThe mind lay open to a more exactAnd close communion. Many are our joysIn youth, but oh! what happiness to liveWhen every hour brings palpable accessOf knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,And every season wheresoe\'er I movedUnfolded transitory qualities, Which, but for this most watchful power of love,Had been neglected; left a registerOf permanent relations, else unknown.Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitudeMore active ever than \'best society\'--Society made sweet as solitudeBy silent inobtrusive sympathies,And gentle agitations of the mindFrom manifold distinctions, differencePerceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye, No difference is, and hence, from the same source,Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone,Under the quiet stars, and at that timeHave felt whate\'er there is of power in soundTo breathe an elevated mood, by formOr image unprofaned; and I would stand,If the night blackened with a coming storm,Beneath some rock, listening to notes that areThe ghostly language of the ancient earth,Or make their dim abode in distant winds. Thence did I drink the visionary power;And deem not profitless those fleeting moodsOf shadowy exultation: not for this,That they are kindred to our purer mindAnd intellectual life; but that the soul,Remembering how she felt, but what she feltRemembering not, retains an obscure senseOf possible sublimity, wheretoWith growing faculties she doth aspire,With faculties still growing, feeling still That whatsoever point they gain, they yetHave something to pursue.And not alone,\'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less \'mid fairAnd tranquil scenes, that universal powerAnd fitness in the latent qualitiesAnd essences of things, by which the mindIs moved with feelings of delight, to meCame strengthened with a superadded soul,A virtue not its own. My morning walksWere early;--oft before the hours of school I travelled round our little lake, five milesOf pleasant wandering. Happy time! more dearFor this, that one was by my side, a Friend,Then passionately loved; with heart how fullWould he peruse these lines! For many yearsHave since flowed in between us, and, our mindsBoth silent to each other, at this timeWe live as if those hours had never been.Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latchFar earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen From human dwelling, or the vernal thrushWas audible; and sate among the woodsAlone upon some jutting eminence,At the first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,Yet slumbering, lay in utter solitude.How shall I seek the origin? where findFaith in the marvellous things which then I felt?Oft in these moments such a holy calmWould overspread my soul, that bodily eyesWere utterly forgotten, and what I saw Appeared like something in myself, a dream,A prospect in the mind.\'Twere long to tellWhat spring and autumn, what the winter snows,And what the summer shade, what day and night,Evening and morning, sleep and waking, thoughtFrom sources inexhaustible, poured forthTo feed the spirit of religious loveIn which I walked with Nature. But let thisBe not forgotten, that I still retainedMy first creative sensibility; That by the regular action of the worldMy soul was unsubdued. A plastic powerAbode with me; a forming hand, at timesRebellious, acting in a devious mood;A local spirit of his own, at warWith general tendency, but, for the most,Subservient strictly to external thingsWith which it communed. An auxiliar lightCame from my mind, which on the setting sunBestowed new splendour; the melodious birds, The fluttering breezes, fountains that run onMurmuring so sweetly in themselves, obeyedA like dominion, and the midnight stormGrew darker in the presence of my eye:Hence my obeisance, my devotion hence,And hence my transport.Nor should this, perchance,Pass unrecorded, that I still had lovedThe exercise and produce of a toil,Than analytic industry to meMore pleasing, and whose character I deem Is more poetic as resembling moreCreative agency. The song would speakOf that interminable building rearedBy observation of affinitiesIn objects where no brotherhood existsTo passive minds. My seventeenth year was comeAnd, whether from this habit rooted nowSo deeply in my mind, or from excessIn the great social principle of lifeCoercing all things into sympathy, To unorganic natures were transferredMy own enjoyments; or the power of truthComing in revelation, did converseWith things that really are; I, at this time,Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.Thus while the days flew by, and years passed on,From Nature and her overflowing soul,I had received so much, that all my thoughtsWere steeped in feeling; I was only thenContented, when with bliss ineffable I felt the sentiment of Being spreadO\'er all that moves and all that seemeth still;O\'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thoughtAnd human knowledge, to the human eyeInvisible, yet liveth to the heart;O\'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,Or beats the gladsome air; o\'er all that glidesBeneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself,And mighty depth of waters. Wonder notIf high the transport, great the joy I felt, Communing in this sort through earth and heavenWith every form of creature, as it lookedTowards the Uncreated with a countenanceOf adoration, with an eye of love.One song they sang, and it was audible,Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear,O\'ercome by humblest prelude of that strainForgot her functions, and slept undisturbed.If this be error, and another faithFind easier access to the pious mind, Yet were I grossly destitute of allThose human sentiments that make this earthSo dear, if I should fail with grateful voiceTo speak of you, ye mountains, and ye lakesAnd sounding cataracts, ye mists and windsThat dwell among the hills where I was born.If in my youth I have been pure in heart,If, mingling with the world, I am contentWith my own modest pleasures, and have livedWith God and Nature communing, removed From little enmities and low desires--The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,This melancholy waste of hopes o\'erthrown,If, \'mid indifference and apathy,And wicked exultation when good menOn every side fall off, we know not how,To selfishness, disguised in gentle namesOf peace and quiet and domestic loveYet mingled not unwillingly with sneersOn visionary minds; if, in this time Of dereliction and dismay, I yetDespair not of our nature, but retainA more than Roman confidence, a faithThat fails not, in all sorrow my support,The blessing of my life--the gift is yours,Ye winds and sounding cataracts! \'tis yours,Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fedMy lofty speculations; and in thee,For this uneasy heart of ours, I findA never-failing principle of joy And purest passion.Thou, my Friend! wert rearedIn the great city, \'mid far other scenes;But we, by different roads, at length have gainedThe selfsame bourne. And for this cause to theeI speak, unapprehensive of contempt,The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,And all that silent language which so oftIn conversation between man and manBlots from the human countenance all traceOf beauty and of love. For thou hast sought The truth in solitude, and, since the daysThat gave thee liberty, full long desired,To serve in Nature\'s temple, thou hast beenThe most assiduous of her ministers;In many things my brother, chiefly hereIn this our deep devotion.Fare thee well!Health and the quiet of a healthful mindAttend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,And yet more often living with thyself,And for thyself, so haply shall thy days Be many, and a blessing to mankind.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMark The Concentrated Hazels That Enclose\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMARK the concentred hazels that encloseYon old grey Stone, protected from the rayOf noontide suns:--and even the beams that playAnd glance, while wantonly the rough wind blows,Are seldom free to touch the moss that growsUpon that roof, amid embowering gloom,The very image framing of a Tomb,In which some ancient Chieftain finds reposeAmong the lonely mountains.--Live, ye trees!And thou, grey Stone, the pensive likeness keep Of a dark chamber where the Mighty sleep:For more than Fancy to the influence bendsWhen solitary Nature condescendsTo mimic Time\'s forlorn humanities.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Simplon Pass\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n------Brook and road Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy Pass, And with them did we journey several hours At a slow step. The immeasurable height Of woods decaying, never to be decayed, The stationary blasts of waterfalls, And in the narrow rent, at every turn, Winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn, The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky, The rocks that muttered close upon our ears, Black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside As if a voice were in them, the sick sight And giddy prospect of the raving stream, The unfettered clouds and region of the heavens, Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light-- Were all like workings of one mind, the features Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree, Characters of the great Apocalypse, The types and symbols of Eternity, Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nStar-Gazers\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHAT crowd is this? what have we here! we must not pass it by;A Telescope upon its frame, and pointed to the sky:Long is it as a barber\'s pole, or mast of little boat,Some little pleasure-skiff, that doth on Thames\'s waters float.The Showman chooses well his place, \'tis Leicester\'s busy Square;And is as happy in his night, for the heavens are blue and fair;Calm, though impatient, is the crowd; each stands ready with the fee,And envies him that\'s looking;--what an insight must it be!Yet, Showman, where can lie the cause? Shall thy Implement have blame,A boaster, that when he is tried, fails, and is put to shame? Or is it good as others are, and be their eyes in fault?Their eyes, or minds? or, finally, is yon resplendent vault?Is nothing of that radiant pomp so good as we have here?Or gives a thing but small delight that never can be dear?The silver moon with all her vales, and hills of mightiest fame,Doth she betray us when they\'re seen? or are they but a name?Or is it rather that Conceit rapacious is and strong,And bounty never yields so much but it seems to do her wrong?Or is it, that when human Souls a journey long have hadAnd are returned into themselves, they cannot but be sad? Or must we be constrained to think that these Spectators rude,Poor in estate, of manners base, men of the multitude,Have souls which never yet have risen, and therefore prostrate lie?No, no, this cannot be;--men thirst for power and majesty!Does, then, a deep and earnest thought the blissful mind employOf him who gazes, or has gazed? a grave and steady joy,That doth reject all show of pride, admits no outward sign,Because not of this noisy world, but silent and divine!Whatever be the cause, \'tis sure that they who pry and poreSeem to meet with little gain, seem less happy than before: One after One they take their turn, nor have I one espiedThat doth not slackly go away, as if dissatisfied.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMemorials Of A Tour Of Scotland, 1803  Vi. Glen-Almain, Or, The Narrow Glen\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIN this still place, remote from men,Sleeps Ossian, in the NARROW GLEN;In this still place, where murmurs onBut one meek streamlet, only one:He sang of battles, and the breathOf stormy war, and violent death;And should, methinks, when all was past,Have rightfully been laid at lastWhere rocks were rudely heaped, and rentAs by a spirit turbulent;Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild, And everything unreconciled;In some complaining, dim retreat,For fear and melancholy meet;But this is calm; there cannot beA more entire tranquillity.Does then the Bard sleep here indeed?Or is it but a groundless creed?What matters it?--I blame them notWhose Fancy in this lonely SpotWas moved; and in such way expressed Their notion of its perfect rest.A convent, even a hermit\'s cell,Would break the silence of this Dell:It is not quiet, is not ease;But something deeper far than these:The separation that is hereIs of the grave; and of austereYet happy feelings of the dead:And, therefore, was it rightly saidThat Ossian, last of all his race! Lies buried in this lonely place.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Longest Day\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLet us quit the leafy arbor, And the torrent murmuring by; For the sun is in his harbor, Weary of the open sky. Evening now unbinds the fetters Fashioned by the glowing light; All that breathe are thankful debtors To the harbinger of night. Yet by some grave thoughts attended Eve renews her calm career; For the day that now is ended, Is the longest of the year. Dora! sport, as now thou sportest, On this platform, light and free; Take thy bliss, while longest, shortest, Are indifferent to thee! Who would check the happy feeling That inspires the linnet\'s song? Who would stop the swallow, wheeling On her pinions swift and strong? Yet at this impressive season, Words which tenderness can speak From the truths of homely reason, Might exalt the loveliest cheek; And, while shades to shades succeeding Steal the landscape from the sight, I would urge this moral pleading, Last forerunner of "Good night!" Summer ebbs; -- each day that follows Is a reflux from on high, Tending to the darksome hollows Where the frosts of winter lie. He who governs the creation, In his providence, assigned Such a gradual declination To the life of human kind. Yet we mark it not; -- fruits redden, Fresh flowers blow, as flowers have blown, And the heart is loth to deaden Hopes that she so long hath known. Be thou wiser, youthful Maiden! And when thy decline shall come, Let not dowers, or boughs fruit-laden, Hide the knowledge of thy doom. Now, even now, ere wrapped in slumber, Fix thine eyes upon the sea That absorbs time, space, and number; Look thou to Eternity! Follow thou the flowing river On whose breast are thither borne All deceived, and each deceiver, Through the gates of night and morn; Through the year\'s successive portals; Through the bounds which many a star Marks, not mindless of frail mortals, When his light returns from far. Thus when thou with Time hast travelled Toward the mighty gulf of things, And the mazy stream unravelled With thy best imaginings; Think, if thou on beauty leanest, Think how pitiful that stay, Did not virtue give the meanest Charms superior to decay. Duty, like a strict preceptor, Sometimes frowns, or seems to frown; Choose her thistle for thy sceptre, While youth\'s roses are thy crown. Grasp it, -- if thou shrink and tremble, Fairest damsel of the green, Thou wilt lack the only symbol That proclaims a genuine queen; And ensures those palms of honor Which selected spirits wear, Bending low before the Donor, Lord of heaven\'s unchanging year!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nStray Pleasures\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBY their floating mill,That lies dead and still,Behold yon Prisoners three,The Miller with two Dames, on the breast of the Thames!The platform is small, but gives room for them all;And they\'re dancing merrily.From the shore come the notesTo their mill where it floats,To their house and their mill tethered fast:To the small wooden isle where, their work to beguile, They from morning to even take whatever is given;--And many a blithe day they have past.In sight of the spires,All alive with the firesOf the sun going down to his rest,In the broad open eye of the solitary sky,They dance,--there are three, as jocund as free,While they dance on the calm river\'s breast.Man and Maidens wheel,They themselves make the reel, And their music\'s a prey which they seize;It plays not for them,--what matter? \'tis theirs;And if they had care, it has scattered their cares,While they dance, crying, \'Long as ye please!\'They dance not for me,Yet mine is their glee!Thus pleasure is spread through the earthIn stray gifts to be claimed by whoever shall find;Thus a rich loving-kindness, redundantly kind,Moves all nature to gladness and mirth. The showers of the springRouse the birds, and they sing;If the wind do but stir for his proper delight,Each leaf, that and this, his neighbour will kiss;Each wave, one and t\' other, speeds after his brother:They are happy, for that is their right!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo The Daisy (First Poem)\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n"Her divine skill taught me this, That from every thing I saw I could some instruction draw, And raise pleasure to the height Through the meanest objects sight. By the murmur of a spring, Or the least bough\'s rustelling; By a Daisy whose leaves spread Shut when Titan goes to bed; Or a shady bush or tree; She could more infuse in me Than all Nature\'s beauties can In some other wiser man.\' G. Wither. * His muse. IN youth from rock to rock I went, From hill to hill in discontent Of pleasure high and turbulent, Most pleased when most uneasy; But now my own delights I make,-- My thirst at every rill can slake, And gladly Nature\'s love partake, Of Thee, sweet Daisy! Thee Winter in the garland wears That thinly decks his few grey hairs; Spring parts the clouds with softest airs, That she may sun thee; Whole Summer-fields are thine by right; And Autumn, melancholy Wight! Doth in thy crimson head delight When rains are on thee. In shoals and bands, a morrice train, Thou greet\'st the traveller in the lane; Pleased at his greeting thee again; Yet nothing daunted, Nor grieved if thou be set at nought: And oft alone in nooks remote We meet thee, like a pleasant thought, When such are wanted. Be violets in their secret mews The flowers the wanton Zephyrs choose; Proud be the rose, with rains and dews Her head impearling, Thou liv\'st with less ambitious aim, Yet hast not gone without thy fame; Thou art indeed by many a claim The Poet\'s darling. If to a rock from rains he fly, Or, some bright day of April sky, Imprisoned by hot sunshine lie Near the green holly, And wearily at length should fare; He needs but look about, and there Thou art!--a friend at hand, to scare His melancholy. A hundred times, by rock or bower, Ere thus I have lain couched an hour, Have I derived from thy sweet power Some apprehension; Some steady love; some brief delight; Some memory that had taken flight; Some chime of fancy wrong or right; Or stray invention. If stately passions in me burn, And one chance look to Thee should turn, I drink out of an humbler urn A lowlier pleasure; The homely sympathy that heeds The common life, our nature breeds; A wisdom fitted to the needs Of hearts at leisure. Fresh-smitten by the morning ray, When thou art up, alert and gay, Then, cheerful Flower! my spirits play With kindred gladness: And when, at dusk, by dews opprest Thou sink\'st, the image of thy rest Hath often eased my pensive breast Of careful sadness. And all day long I number yet, All seasons through, another debt, Which I, wherever thou art met, To thee am owing; An instinct call it, a blind sense; A happy, genial influence, Coming one knows not how, nor whence, Nor whither going. Child of the Year! that round dost run Thy pleasant course,--when day\'s begun As ready to salute the sun As lark or leveret, Thy long-lost praise thou shalt regain; Nor be less dear to future men Than in old time;--thou not in vain Art Nature\'s favourite.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBook Eleventh: France  [concluded]\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM that time forth, Authority in FrancePut on a milder face; Terror had ceased,Yet everything was wanting that might giveCourage to them who looked for good by lightOf rational Experience, for the shootsAnd hopeful blossoms of a second spring:Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;The Senate\'s language, and the public actsAnd measures of the Government, though bothWeak, and of heartless omen, had not power To daunt me; in the People was my trust:And, in the virtues which mine eyes had seen,I knew that wound external could not takeLife from the young Republic; that new foesWould only follow, in the path of shame,Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the endGreat, universal, irresistible.This intuition led me to confoundOne victory with another, higher far,--Triumphs of unambitious peace at home, And noiseless fortitude. Beholding stillResistance strong as heretofore, I thoughtThat what was in degree the same was likewiseThe same in quality,--that, as the worseOf the two spirits then at strife remainedUntired, the better, surely, would preserveThe heart that first had roused him. Youth maintains,In all conditions of society,Communion more direct and intimateWith Nature,--hence, ofttimes, with reason too-- Than age or manhood, even. To Nature, then,Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,Had left an interregnum\'s open spaceFor \'her\' to move about in, uncontrolled.Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,Who, by the recent deluge stupified,With their whole souls went culling from the dayIts petty promises, to build a towerFor their own safety; laughed with my compeersAt gravest heads, by enmity to France Distempered, till they found, in every blastForced from the street-disturbing newsman\'s horn,For her great cause record or prophecyOf utter ruin. How might we believeThat wisdom could, in any shape, come nearMen clinging to delusions so insane?And thus, experience proving that no fewOf our opinions had been just, we tookLike credit to ourselves where less was due,And thought that other notions were as sound Yea, could not but be right, because we sawThat foolish men opposed them.To a strainMore animated I might here give way,And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,What in those days, through Britain, was performedTo turn \'all\' judgments out of their right course;But this is passion over-near ourselves,Reality too close and too intense,And intermixed with something, in my mind,Of scorn and condemnation personal, That would profane the sanctity of verse.Our Shepherds, this say merely, at that timeActed, or seemed at least to act, like menThirsting to make the guardian crook of lawA tool of murder; they who ruled the State--Though with such awful proof before their eyesThat he, who would sow death, reaps death, or worse,And can reap nothing better--child-like longedTo imitate, not wise enough to avoid;Or left (by mere timidity betrayed) The plain straight road, for one no better chosenThan if their wish had been to undermineJustice, and make an end of Liberty.But from these bitter truths I must returnTo my own history. It hath been toldThat I was led to take an eager partIn arguments of civil polity,Abruptly, and indeed before my time:I had approached, like other youths, the shieldOf human nature from the golden side, And would have fought, even to the death, to attestThe quality of the metal which I saw.What there is best in individual man,Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,Benevolent in small societies,And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understoodBy reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,As cause was given me afterwards to learn,Not proof against the injuries of the day; Lodged only at the sanctuary\'s door,Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,And with such general insight into evil,And of the bounds which sever it from good,As books and common intercourse with lifeMust needs have given--to the inexperienced mind,When the world travels in a beaten road,Guide faithful as is needed--I beganTo meditate with ardour on the ruleAnd management of nations; what it is And ought to be; and strove to learn how farTheir power or weakness, wealth or poverty,Their happiness or misery, dependsUpon their laws, and fashion of the State.O pleasant exercise of hope and joy!For mighty were the auxiliars which then stoodUpon our side, us who were strong in love!Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,But to be young was very Heaven! O times,In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways Of custom, law, and statute, took at onceThe attraction of a country in romance!When Reason seemed the most to assert her rightsWhen most intent on making of herselfA prime enchantress--to assist the work,Which then was going forward in her name!Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,The beauty wore of promise--that which sets(As at some moments might not be unfeltAmong the bowers of Paradise itself) The budding rose above the rose full blown.What temper at the prospect did not wakeTo happiness unthought of? The inertWere roused, and lively natures rapt away!They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,The play-fellows of fancy, who had madeAll powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strengthTheir ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirredAmong the grandest objects of the sense,And dealt with whatsoever they found there As if they had within some lurking rightTo wield it;--they, too, who of gentle moodHad watched all gentle motions, and to theseHad fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,And in the region of their peaceful selves;--Now was it that \'both\' found, the meek and loftyDid both find, helpers to their hearts\' desire,And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,--Were called upon to exercise their skill,Not in Utopia,--subterranean fields,-- Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!But in the very world, which is the worldOf all of us,--the place where, in the end,We find our happiness, or not at all!Why should I not confess that Earth was thenTo me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,Seems, when the first time visited, to oneWho thither comes to find in it his home?He walks about and looks upon the spotWith cordial transport, moulds it and remoulds, And is half-pleased with things that are amiss,\'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.An active partisan, I thus convokedFrom every object pleasant circumstanceTo suit my ends; I moved among mankindWith genial feelings still predominant;When erring, erring on the better part,And in the kinder spirit; placable,Indulgent, as not uninformed that menSee as they have been taught--Antiquity Gives rights to error; and aware, no lessThat throwing off oppression must be workAs well of License as of Liberty;And above all--for this was more than all--Not caring if the wind did now and thenBlow keen upon an eminence that gaveProspect so large into futurity;In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,Diffusing only those affections widerThat from the cradle had grown up with me, And losing, in no other way than lightIs lost in light, the weak in the more strong.In the main outline, such it might be saidWas my condition, till with open warBritain opposed the liberties of France.This threw me first out of the pale of love;Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,A swallowing up of lesser things in great,But change of them into their contraries; And thus a way was opened for mistakesAnd false conclusions, in degree as gross,In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,Was now a shame; my likings and my lovesRan in new channels, leaving old ones dry;And hence a blow that, in maturer age,Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deepInto sensations near the heart: meantime,As from the first, wild theories were afloat,To whose pretensions, sedulously urged, I had but lent a careless ear, assuredThat time was ready to set all things right,And that the multitude, so long oppressed,Would be oppressed no more.But when eventsBrought less encouragement, and unto theseThe immediate proof of principles no moreCould be entrusted, while the events themselves,Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,Less occupied the mind, and sentimentsCould through my understanding\'s natural growth No longer keep their ground, by faith maintainedOf inward consciousness, and hope that laidHer hand upon her object--evidenceSafer, of universal application, suchAs could not be impeached, was sought elsewhere.But now, become oppressors in their turn,Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defenceFor one of conquest, losing sight of allWhich they had struggled for: up mounted now,Openly in the eye of earth and heaven, The scale of liberty. I read her doom,With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,But not dismayed, nor taking to the shameOf a false prophet. While resentment roseStriving to hide, what nought could heal, the woundsOf mortified presumption, I adheredMore firmly to old tenets, and, to proveTheir temper, strained them more; and thus, in heatOf contest, did opinions every dayGrow into consequence, till round my mind They clung, as if they were its life, nay more,The very being of the immortal soul.This was the time, when, all things tending fastTo depravation, speculative schemes--That promised to abstract the hopes of ManOut of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforthFor ever in a purer element--Found ready welcome. Tempting region \'that\'For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,Where passions had the privilege to work, And never hear the sound of their own names.But, speaking more in charity, the dreamFlattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor leastWith that which makes our Reason\'s naked selfThe object of its fervour. What delight!How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,To look through all the frailties of the world,And, with a resolute mastery shaking offInfirmities of nature, time, and place,Build social upon personal Liberty, Which, to the blind restraints of general laws,Superior, magisterially adoptsOne guide, the light of circumstances, flashedUpon an independent intellect.Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,I scorned indifference; but, inflamed with thirstOf a secure intelligence, and sickOf other longing, I pursued what seemed A more exalted nature; wished that ManShould start out of his earthy, worm-like state,And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,Lord of himself, in undisturbed delight--A noble aspiration! \'yet\' I feel(Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)The aspiration, nor shall ever ceaseTo feel it;--but return we to our course.Enough, \'tis true--could such a plea excuseThose aberrations--had the clamorous friends Of ancient Institutions said and doneTo bring disgrace upon their very names;Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,And sundry moral sentiments as propsOr emanations of those institutes,Too justly bore a part. A veil had beenUplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,\'Twas even so; and sorrow for the manWho either had not eyes wherewith to see,Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock Was given to old opinions; all men\'s mindsHad felt its power, and mine was both let loose,Let loose and goaded. After what hath beenAlready said of patriotic love,Suffice it here to add, that, somewhat sternIn temperament, withal a happy man,And therefore bold to look on painful things,Free likewise of the world, and thence more bold,I summoned my best skill, and toiled, intentTo anatomise the frame of social life; Yea, the whole body of societySearched to its heart. Share with me, Friend! the wishThat some dramatic tale, endued with shapesLivelier, and flinging out less guarded wordsThan suit the work we fashion, might set forthWhat then I learned, or think I learned, of truth,And the errors into which I fell, betrayedBy present objects, and by reasonings falseFrom their beginnings, inasmuch as drawnOut of a heart that had been turned aside From Nature\'s way by outward accidents,And which was thus confounded, more and moreMisguided, and misguiding. So I fared,Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,Suspiciously, to establish in plain dayHer titles and her honours; now believing,Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexedWith impulse, motive, right and wrong, the groundOf obligation, what the rule and whence The sanction; till, demanding formal \'proof\',And seeking it in every thing, I lostAll feeling of conviction, and, in fine,Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,Yielded up moral questions in despair.This was the crisis of that strong disease,This the soul\'s last and lowest ebb; I drooped,Deeming our blessed reason of least useWhere wanted most: \'The lordly attributesOf will and choice,\' I bitterly exclaimed \'What are they but a mockery of a BeingWho hath in no concerns of his a testOf good and evil; knows not what to fearOr hope for, what to covet or to shun;And who, if those could be discerned, would yetBe little profited, would see, and askWhere is the obligation to enforce?And, to acknowledged law rebellious, still,As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;The dupe of folly, or the slave of crime.\' Depressed, bewildered thus, I did not walkWith scoffers, seeking light and gay revengeFrom indiscriminate laughter, nor sate downIn reconcilement with an utter wasteOf intellect; such sloth I could not brook,(Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,Pains-taking thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)But turned to abstract science, and there soughtWork for the reasoning faculty enthronedWhere the disturbances of space and time-- Whether in matters various, propertiesInherent, or from human will and powerDerived--find no admission. Then it was--Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!--That the beloved Sister in whose sightThose days were passed, now speaking in a voiceOf sudden admonition--like a brookThat did but \'cross\' a lonely road, and nowIs seen, heard, felt, and caught at every turn,Companion never lost through many a league-- Maintained for me a saving intercourseWith my true self; for, though bedimmed and changedMuch, as it seemed, I was no further changedThan as a clouded and a waning moon:She whispered still that brightness would return;She, in the midst of all, preserved me stillA Poet, made me seek beneath that name,And that alone, my office upon earth;And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,If willing audience fail not, Nature\'s self, By all varieties of human loveAssisted, led me back through opening dayTo those sweet counsels between head and heartWhence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with peace,Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,Hath still upheld me, and upholds me nowIn the catastrophe (for so they dream,And nothing less), when, finally to closeAnd seal up all the gains of France, a PopeIs summoned in, to crown an Emperor-- This last opprobrium, when we see a people,That once looked up in faith, as if to HeavenFor manna, take a lesson from the dogReturning to his vomit; when the sunThat rose in splendour, was alive, and movedIn exultation with a living pompOf clouds--his glory\'s natural retinue--Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,And, turned into a gewgaw, a machine,Sets like an Opera phantom.Thus, O Friend! Through times of honour and through times of shameDescending, have I faithfully retracedThe perturbations of a youthful mindUnder a long-lived storm of great events--A story destined for thy ear, who now,Among the fallen of nations, dost abideWhere Etna, over hill and valley, castsHis shadow stretching towards Syracuse,The city of Timoleon! Righteous Heaven!How are the mighty prostrated! They first, They first of all that breathe should have awakedWhen the great voice was heard from out the tombsOf ancient heroes. If I suffered griefFor ill-requited France, by many deemedA trifler only in her proudest day;Have been distressed to think of what she oncePromised, now is; a far more sober causeThine eyes must see of sorrow in a land,To the reanimating influence lostOf memory, to virtue lost and hope, Though with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn.But indignation works where hope is not,And thou, O Friend! wilt be refreshed. There isOne great society alone on earth:The noble Living and the noble Dead.Thine be such converse strong and sanative,A ladder for thy spirit to reascendTo health and joy and pure contentedness;To me the grief confined, that thou art goneFrom this last spot of earth, where Freedom now Stands single in her only sanctuary;A lonely wanderer, art gone, by painCompelled and sickness, at this latter day,This sorrowful reverse for all mankind.I feel for thee, must utter what I feel:The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,Gather afresh, and will have vent again:My own delights do scarcely seem to meMy own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks Abroad on many nations, are no moreFor me that image of pure gladsomenessWhich they were wont to be.

Not in vainThose temples, where they in their ruins yetSurvive for inspiration, shall attractThy solitary steps: and on the brinkThou wilt recline of pastoral Arethuse;Or, if that fountain be in truth no more,Then, near some other spring--which, by the nameThou gratulatest, willingly deceived--I see thee linger a glad votary,And not a captive pining for his home.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Sonnet I\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNUNS fret not at their convent\'s narrow room, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And hermits are contented with their cells, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And students with their pensive citadels; Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86High as the highest peak of Furness fells, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells: In truth the prison unto which we doom Ourselves no prison is: and hence for me, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86In sundry moods, \'twas pastime to be bound \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Within the Sonnet\'s scanty plot of ground; Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be) Who have felt the weight of too much liberty, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Should find brief solace there, as I have found.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMemorials Of A Tour In Scotland, 1803  Xii.

Now we start afreshWith courage, and new hope risen on our toil.Fair greetings to this shapeless eagerness,Whene\'er it comes! needful in work so long, Thrice needful to the argument which nowAwaits us! Oh, how much unlike the past!Free as a colt at pasture on the hill,I ranged at large, through London\'s wide domain,Month after month. Obscurely did I live,Not seeking frequent intercourse with men,By literature, or elegance, or rank,Distinguished. Scarcely was a year thus spentEre I forsook the crowded solitude,With less regret for its luxurious pomp, And all the nicely-guarded shows of art,Than for the humble book-stalls in the streets,Exposed to eye and hand where\'er I turned.France lured me forth; the realm that I had crossedSo lately, journeying toward the snow-clad Alps.But now, relinquishing the scrip and staff,And all enjoyment which the summer sunSheds round the steps of those who meet the dayWith motion constant as his own, I wentPrepared to sojourn in a pleasant town, Washed by the current of the stately Loire.Through Paris lay my readiest course, and thereSojourning a few days, I visitedIn haste, each spot of old or recent fame,The latter chiefly, from the field of MarsDown to the suburbs of St. Antony,And from Mont Martre southward to the DomeOf Genevieve. In both her clamorous Halls,The National Synod and the Jacobins,I saw the Revolutionary Power Toss like a ship at anchor, rocked by storms;The Arcades I traversed, in the Palace hugeOf Orleans; coasted round and round the lineOf Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop,Great rendezvous of worst and best, the walkOf all who had a purpose, or had not;I stared and listened, with a stranger\'s ears,To Hawkers and Haranguers, hubbub wild!And hissing Factionists with ardent eyes,In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look Hope takes, or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear,But seemed there present; and I scanned them all,Watched every gesture uncontrollable,Of anger, and vexation, and despite,All side by side, and struggling face to face,With gaiety and dissolute idleness.Where silent zephyrs sported with the dustOf the Bastille, I sate in the open sun,And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,And pocketed the relic, in the guise Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth,I looked for something that I could not find,Affecting more emotion than I felt;For \'tis most certain, that these various sights,However potent their first shock, with meAppeared to recompense the traveller\'s painsLess than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun,A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hairDishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheekPale and bedropped with overflowing tears. But hence to my more permanent abodeI hasten; there, by novelties in speech,Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,And all the attire of ordinary life,Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,I stood \'mid those concussions, unconcerned,Tranquil almost, and careless as a flowerGlassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrubThat spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,While every bush and tree, the country through, Is shaking to the roots: indifference thisWhich may seem strange: but I was unpreparedWith needful knowledge, had abruptly passedInto a theatre, whose stage was filledAnd busy with an action far advanced.Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes readWith care, the master pamphlets of the day;Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wildUpon that meagre soil, helped out by talkAnd public news; but having never seen A chronicle that might suffice to showWhence the main organs of the public powerHad sprung, their transmigrations, when and howAccomplished, giving thus unto eventsA form and body; all things were to meLoose and disjointed, and the affections leftWithout a vital interest. At that time,Moreover, the first storm was overblown,And the strong hand of outward violenceLocked up in quiet. For myself, I fear Now, in connection with so great a theme,To speak (as I must be compelled to do)Of one so unimportant; night by nightDid I frequent the formal haunts of men,Whom, in the city, privilege of birthSequestered from the rest, societiesPolished in arts, and in punctilio versed;Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourseOf good and evil of the time was shunnedWith scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrewInto a noisier world, and thus ere longBecame a patriot; and my heart was allGiven to the people, and my love was theirs.A band of military Officers,Then stationed in the city, were the chiefOf my associates: some of these wore swordsThat had been seasoned in the wars, and allWere men well-born; the chivalry of France.In age and temper differing, they had yet One spirit ruling in each heart; alike(Save only one, hereafter to be named)Were bent upon undoing what was done:This was their rest and only hope; therewithNo fear had they of bad becoming worse,For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,Or deemed it worth a moment\'s thought to stir,In anything, save only as the actLooked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile He had sate lord in many tender hearts;Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:His temper was quite mastered by the times,And they had blighted him, had eaten awayThe beauty of his person, doing wrongAlike to body and to mind: his port,Which once had been erect and open, nowWas stooping and contracted, and a face,Endowed by Nature with her fairest giftsOf symmetry and light and bloom, expressed, As much as any that was ever seen,A ravage out of season, made by thoughtsUnhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,That from the press of Paris duly broughtIts freight of public news, the fever came,A punctual visitant, to shake this man,Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheekInto a thousand colours; while he read,Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touchContinually, like an uneasy place In his own body. \'Twas in truth an hourOf universal ferment; mildest menWere agitated, and commotions, strifeOf passion and opinion, filled the wallsOf peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.The soil of common life was, at that time,Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,And not then only, \'What a mockery thisOf history, the past and that to come!Now do I feel how all men are deceived, Reading of nations and their works, in faith,Faith given to vanity and emptiness;Oh! laughter for the page that would reflectTo future times the face of what now is!\'The land all swarmed with passion, like a plainDevoured by locusts,--Carra, Gorsas,--addA hundred other names, forgotten now,Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,And felt through every nook of town and field. Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chiefOf my associates stood prepared for flightTo augment the band of emigrants in armsUpon the borders of the Rhine, and leaguedWith foreign foes mustered for instant war.This was their undisguised intent, and theyWere waiting with the whole of their desiresThe moment to depart.An Englishman,Born in a land whose very name appearedTo license some unruliness of mind;A stranger, with youth\'s further privilege, And the indulgence that a half-learnt speechWins from the courteous; I, who had been elseShunned and not tolerated, freely livedWith these defenders of the Crown, and talked,And heard their notions; nor did they disdainThe wish to bring me over to their cause.But though untaught by thinking or by booksTo reason well of polity or law,And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,Of natural rights and civil; and to acts Of nations and their passing interests,(If with unworldly ends and aims compared)Almost indifferent, even the historian\'s talePrizing but little otherwise than I prizedTales of the poets, as it made the heartBeat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,Old heroes and their sufferings and their deeds;Yet in the regal sceptre, and the pompOf orders and degrees, I nothing foundThen, or had ever, even in crudest youth, That dazzled me, but rather what I mournedAnd ill could brook, beholding that the bestRuled not, and feeling that they ought to rule.For, born in a poor district, and which yetRetaineth more of ancient homeliness,Than any other nook of English ground,It was my fortune scarcely to have seen,Through the whole tenor of my school-day time,The face of one, who, whether boy or man,Was vested with attention or respect Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it leastOf many benefits, in later yearsDerived from academic institutesAnd rules, that they held something up to viewOf a Republic, where all stood thus farUpon equal ground; that we were brothers allIn honour, as in one community,Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,Distinction open lay to all that came,And wealth and titles were in less esteem Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry,Add unto this, subservience from the firstTo presences of God\'s mysterious powerMade manifest in Nature\'s sovereignty,And fellowship with venerable books,To sanction the proud workings of the soul,And mountain liberty. It could not beBut that one tutored thus should look with aweUpon the faculties of man, receiveGladly the highest promises, and hail, As best, the government of equal rightsAnd individual worth. And hence, O Friend!If at the first great outbreak I rejoicedLess than might well befit my youth, the causeIn part lay here, that unto me the eventsSeemed nothing out of nature\'s certain course,A gift that was come rather late than soon.No wonder, then, if advocates like these,Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,And stung with injury, at this riper day, Were impotent to make my hopes put onThe shape of theirs, my understanding bendIn honour to their honour: zeal, which yetHad slumbered, now in opposition burstForth like a Polar summer: every wordThey uttered was a dart, by counter-windsBlown back upon themselves; their reason seemedConfusion-stricken by a higher powerThan human understanding, their discourseMaimed, spiritless; and, in their weakness strong, I triumphed.Meantime, day by day, the roadsWere crowded with the bravest youth of France,And all the promptest of her spirits, linkedIn gallant soldiership, and posting onTo meet the war upon her frontier bounds.Yet at this very moment do tears startInto mine eyes: I do not say I weep--I wept not then,--but tears have dimmed my sight,In memory of the farewells of that time,Domestic severings, female fortitude At dearest separation, patriot loveAnd self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,Encouraged with a martyr\'s confidence;Even files of strangers merely seen but once,And for a moment, men from far with soundOf music, martial tunes, and banners spread,Entering the city, here and there a face,Or person, singled out among the rest,Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;Even by these passing spectacles my heart Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemedArguments sent from Heaven to prove the causeGood, pure, which no one could stand up against,Who was not lost, abandoned, selfish, proud,Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,Hater perverse of equity and truth.Among that band of Officers was one,Already hinted at, of other mould--A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,And with an oriental loathing spurned, As of a different caste. A meeker manThan this lived never, nor a more benign,Meek though enthusiastic. InjuriesMade \'him\' more gracious, and his nature thenDid breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,When foot hath crushed them. He through the eventsOf that great change wandered in perfect faith,As through a book, an old romance, or taleOf Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought Behind the summer clouds. By birth he rankedWith the most noble, but unto the poorAmong mankind he was in service bound,As by some tie invisible, oaths professedTo a religious order. Man he lovedAs man; and, to the mean and the obscure,And all the homely in their homely works,Transferred a courtesy which had no airOf condescension; but did rather seemA passion and a gallantry, like that Which he, a soldier, in his idler dayHad paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,But fondness, and a kind of radiant joyDiffused around him, while he was intentOn works of love or freedom, or revolvedComplacently the progress of a cause,Whereof he was a part: yet this was meekAnd placid, and took nothing from the manThat was delightful. Oft in solitude With him did I discourse about the endOf civil government, and its wisest forms;Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,Custom and habit, novelty and change;Of self-respect, and virtue in the fewFor patrimonial honour set apart,And ignorance in the labouring multitude.For he, to all intolerance indisposed,Balanced these contemplations in his mind;And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgmentThan later days allowed; carried about me,With less alloy to its integrity,The experience of past ages, as, through helpOf books and common life, it makes sure wayTo youthful minds, by objects over nearNot pressed upon, nor dazzled or misledBy struggling with the crowd for present ends.But though not deaf, nor obstinate to findError without excuse upon the side Of them who strove against us, more delightWe took, and let this freely be confessed,In painting to ourselves the miseriesOf royal courts, and that voluptuous lifeUnfeeling, where the man who is of soulThe meanest thrives the most; where dignity,True personal dignity, abideth not;A light, a cruel, and vain world cut offFrom the natural inlets of just sentiment,From lowly sympathy and chastening truth; Where good and evil interchange their names,And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is pairedWith vice at home. We added dearest themes--Man and his noble nature, as it isThe gift which God has placed within his power,His blind desires and steady facultiesCapable of clear truth, the one to breakBondage, the other to build libertyOn firm foundations, making social life,Through knowledge spreading and imperishable, As just in regulation, and as pureAs individual in the wise and good.We summoned up the honourable deedsOf ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,That would be found in all recorded time,Of truth preserved and error passed away;Of single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,And how the multitudes of men will feedAnd fan each other; thought of sects, how keenThey are to put the appropriate nature on, Triumphant over every obstacleOf custom, language, country, love, or hate,And what they do and suffer for their creed;How far they travel, and how long endure;How quickly mighty Nations have been formed,From least beginnings; how, together lockedBy new opinions, scattered tribes have madeOne body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven.To aspirations then of our own mindsDid we appeal; and, finally, beheld A living confirmation of the wholeBefore us, in a people from the depthOf shameful imbecility uprisen,Fresh as the morning star. Elate we lookedUpon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,And continence of mind, and sense of right,Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known In the green dales beside our Rotha\'s stream,Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,To ruminate, with interchange of talk,On rational liberty, and hope in man,Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil--Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse--If nature then be standing on the brinkOf some great trial, and we hear the voiceOf one devoted,--one whom circumstanceHath called upon to embody his deep sense In action, give it outwardly a shape,And that of benediction, to the world.Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,--A hope it is, and a desire; a creedOf zeal, by an authority DivineSanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death.Such conversation, under Attic shades,Did Dion hold with Plato; ripened thusFor a Deliverer\'s glorious task,--and suchHe, on that ministry already bound, Held with Eudemus and Timonides,Surrounded by adventurers in arms,When those two vessels with their daring freight,For the Sicilian Tyrant\'s overthrow,Sailed from Zacynthus,--philosophic war,Led by Philosophers. With harder fate,Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!Of whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the nameStand near the worthiest of Antiquity)Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse, With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:He, on his part, accoutred for the worst,He perished fighting, in supreme command,Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,For liberty, against deluded men,His fellow-countrymen; and yet most blessedIn this, that he the fate of later timesLived not to see, nor what we now behold,Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.Along that very Loire, with festal mirth Resounding at all hours, and innocent yetOf civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;Or in wide forests of continuous shade,Lofty and over-arched, with open spaceBeneath the trees, clear footing many a mile--A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,And let remembrance steal to other times,When, o\'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,And smooth as marble or a waveless sea, Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might paceIn sylvan meditation undisturbed;As on the pavement of a Gothic churchWalks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,In peace and silence. But if e\'er was heard,--Heard, though unseen,--a devious traveller,Retiring or approaching from afarWith speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofsFrom the hard floor reverberated, thenIt was Angelica thundering through the woods Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maidErminia, fugitive as fair as she.Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knightsJoust underneath the trees, that as in stormRocked high above their heads; anon, the dinOf boisterous merriment, and music\'s roar,In sudden proclamation, burst from hauntOf Satyrs in some viewless glade, with danceRejoicing o\'er a female in the midst,A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall. The width of those huge forests, unto meA novel scene, did often in this wayMaster my fancy while I wandered onWith that revered companion. And sometimes--When to a convent in a meadow green,By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,And not by reverential touch of TimeDismantled, but by violence abrupt--In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,In spite of real fervour, and of that Less genuine and wrought up within myself--I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,And for the Matin-bell to sound no moreGrieved, and the twilight taper, and the crossHigh on the topmost pinnacle, a sign(How welcome to the weary traveller\'s eyes!)Of hospitality and peaceful rest.And when the partner of those varied walksPointed upon occasion to the siteOf Romorentin, home of ancient kings, To the imperial edifice of Blois,Or to that rural castle, name now slippedFrom my remembrance, where a lady lodged,By the first Francis wooed, and bound to himIn chains of mutual passion, from the tower,As a tradition of the country tells,Practised to commune with her royal knightBy cressets and love-beacons, intercourse\'Twixt her high-seated residence and hisFar off at Chambord on the plain beneath; Even here, though less than with the peaceful houseReligious, \'mid those frequent monumentsOf Kings, their vices and their better deeds,Imagination, potent to inflameAt times with virtuous wrath and noble scorn,Did also often mitigate the forceOf civic prejudice, the bigotry,So call it, of a youthful patriot\'s mind;And on these spots with many gleams I lookedOf chivalrous delight. Yet not the less, Hatred of absolute rule, where will of oneIs law for all, and of that barren prideIn them who, by immunities unjust,Between the sovereign and the people stand,His helper and not theirs, laid stronger holdDaily upon me, mixed with pity tooAnd love; for where hope is, there love will beFor the abject multitude, And when we chancedOne day to meet a hunger-bitten girl,Who crept along fitting her languid gait Unto a heifer\'s motion, by a cordTied to her arm, and picking thus from the laneIts sustenance, while the girl with pallid handsWas busy knitting in a heartless moodOf solitude, and at the sight my friendIn agitation said, \'\'Tis against \'that\'That we are fighting,\' I with him believedThat a benignant spirit was abroadWhich might not be withstood, that povertyAbject as this would in a little time Be found no more, that we should see the earthUnthwarted in her wish to recompenseThe meek, the lowly, patient child of toil,All institutes for ever blotted outThat legalised exclusion, empty pompAbolished, sensual state and cruel powerWhether by edict of the one or few;And finally, as sum and crown of all,Should see the people having a strong handIn framing their own laws; whence better days To all mankind. But, these things set apart,Was not this single confidence enoughTo animate the mind that ever turnedA thought to human welfare? That henceforthCaptivity by mandate without lawShould cease; and open accusation leadTo sentence in the hearing of the world,And open punishment, if not the airBe free to breathe in, and the heart of manDread nothing. From this height I shall not stoop To humbler matter that detained us oftIn thought or conversation, public acts,And public persons, and emotions wroughtWithin the breast, as ever-varying windsOf record or report swept over us;But I might here, instead, repeat a tale,Told by my Patriot friend, of sad events,That prove to what low depth had struck the roots,How widely spread the boughs, of that old treeWhich, as a deadly mischief, and a foul And black dishonour, France was weary of.Oh, happy time of youthful lovers, (thusThe story might begin,) oh, balmy time,In which a love-knot, on a lady\'s brow,Is fairer than the fairest star in Heaven!So might--and with that prelude \'did\' beginThe record; and, in faithful verse, was givenThe doleful sequel.But our little barkOn a strong river boldly hath been launched;And from the driving current should we turn To loiter wilfully within a creek,Howe\'er attractive, Fellow voyager!Would\'st thou not chide? Yet deem not my pains lost:For Vaudracour and Julia (so were namedThe ill-fated pair) in that plain tale will drawTears from the hearts of others, when their ownShall beat no more. Thou, also, there may\'st read,At leisure, how the enamoured youth was driven,By public power abased, to fatal crime,Nature\'s rebellion against monstrous law; How, between heart and heart, oppression thrustHer mandates, severing whom true love had joined,Harassing both; until he sank and pressedThe couch his fate had made for him; supine,Save when the stings of viperous remorse,Trying their strength, enforced him to start up,Aghast and prayerless. Into a deep woodHe fled, to shun the haunts of human kind;There dwelt, weakened in spirit more and more;Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France Full speedily resounded, public hope,Or personal memory of his own worst wrongs,Rouse him; but, hidden in those gloomy shades,His days he wasted,--an imbecile mind.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOn The Same Occasion\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n(The Final Submission Of The Tyrolese)YE Storms, resound the praises of your King!And ye mild Seasons--in a sunny clime,Midway on some high hill, while father TimeLooks on delighted--meet in festal ring,And loud and long of Winter\'s triumph sing!Sing ye, with blossoms crowned, and fruits, and flowers,Of Winter\'s breath surcharged with sleety showers,And the dire flapping of his hoary wing!Knit the blithe dance upon the soft green grass;With feet, hands, eyes, looks, lips, report your gain; Whisper it to the billows of the main,And to the aerial zephyrs as they pass,That old decrepit Winter--\'He\' hath slainThat Host, which rendered all your bounties vain!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHoffer\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOF mortal parents is the Hero bornBy whom the undaunted Tyrolese are led?Or is it Tell\'s great Spirit, from the deadReturned to animate an age forlorn?He comes like Phoebus through the gates of mornWhen dreary darkness is discomfited,Yet mark his modest state! upon his head,That simple crest, a heron\'s plume, is worn.O Liberty! they stagger at the shockFrom van to rear--and with one mind would flee, But half their host is buried:--rock on rockDescends:--beneath this godlike Warrior, see!Hills, torrents, woods, embodied to bemockThe Tyrant, and confound his cruelty.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBy Moscow Self-Devoted To A Blaze\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBy Moscow self-devoted to a blazeOf dreadful sacrifice, by Russian bloodLavished in fight with desperate hardihood;The unfeeling Elements no claim shall raiseTo rob our Human-nature of just praiseFor what she did and suffered.

And surelySmall cause there is for that fond wish of oursLong to continue in this world; a world That keeps not faith, nor yet can point a hopeTo good, whereof itself is destitute.IIPERHAPS some needful service of the StateDrew TITUS from the depth of studious bowers,And doomed him to contend in faithless courts,Where gold determines between right and wrong.Yet did at length his loyalty of heart,And his pure native genius, lead him backTo wait upon the bright and gracious Muses,Whom he had early loved. And not in vainSuch course he held! Bologna\'s learned schoolsWere gladdened by the Sage\'s voice, and hung With fondness on those sweet Nestorian strains.There pleasure crowned his days; and all his thoughtsA roseate fragrance breathed.--O human life,That never art secure from dolorous change!Behold a high injunction suddenlyTo Arno\'s side hath brought him, and he charmedA Tuscan audience: but full soon was calledTo the perpetual silence of the grave.Mourn, Italy, the loss of him who stoodA Champion stedfast and invincible, To quell the rage of literary War!IIIO THOU who movest onward with a mindIntent upon thy way, pause, though in haste!\'Twill be no fruitless moment. I was bornWithin Savona\'s walls, of gentle blood.On Tiber\'s banks my youth was dedicateTo sacred studies; and the Roman ShepherdGave to my charge Urbino\'s numerous flock.Well did I watch, much laboured, nor had powerTo escape from many and strange indignities;Was smitten by the great ones of the world, But did not fall; for Virtue braves all shocks,Upon herself resting immoveably.Me did a kindlier fortune then inviteTo serve the glorious Henry, King of France,And in his hands I saw a high rewardStretched out for my acceptance,--but Death came.Now, Reader, learn from this my fate, how false,How treacherous to her promise, is the world;And trust in God--to whose eternal doomMust bend the sceptred Potentates of earth. IVTHERE never breathed a man who, when his lifeWas closing, might not of that life relateToils long and hard.--The warrior will reportOf wounds, and bright swords flashing in the field,And blast of trumpets. He who hath been doomedTo bow his forehead in the courts of kings,Will tell of fraud and never-ceasing hate,Envy and heart-inquietude, derivedFrom intricate cabals of treacherous friends.I, who on shipboard lived from earliest youth, Could represent the countenance horribleOf the vexed waters, and the indignant rageOf Auster and Bootes. Fifty yearsOver the well-steered galleys did I rule:--From huge Pelorus to the Atlantic pillars,Rises no mountain to mine eyes unknown;And the broad gulfs I traversed oft and oft:Of every cloud which in the heavens might stirI knew the force; and hence the rough sea\'s prideAvailed not to my Vessel\'s overthrow. What noble pomp and frequent have not IOn regal decks beheld! yet in the endI learned that one poor moment can sufficeTo equalise the lofty and the low.We sail the sea of life--a \'Calm\' One finds,And One a \'Tempest\'--and, the voyage o\'er,Death is the quiet haven of us all.If more of my condition ye would know,Savona was my birth-place, and I sprangOf noble parents; seventy years and three Lived I--then yielded to a slow disease.VTRUE is it that Ambrosio SalineroWith an untoward fate was long involvedIn odious litigation; and full long,Fate harder still! had he to endure assaultsOf racking malady. And true it isThat not the less a frank courageous heartAnd buoyant spirit triumphed over pain;And he was strong to follow in the stepsOf the fair Muses. Not a covert pathLeads to the dear Parnassian forest\'s shade, That might from him be hidden; not a trackMounts to pellucid Hippocrene, but heHad traced its windings.--This Savona knows,Yet no sepulchral honours to her SonShe paid, for in our age the heart is ruledOnly by gold.

Sing, mournfully, oh! mournfully,     The solitude of Binnorie!The stream that flows out of the lake,As through the glen it rambles,Repeats a moan o\'er moss and stone,For those seven lovely Campbells.Seven little Islands, green and bare,Have risen from out the deep:The fishers say, those sisters fair,By faeries all are buried there,And there together sleep.

He, too, is no mean preacher: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher. She has a world of ready wealth, Our minds and hearts to bless-- Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health, Truth breathed by cheerfulness. One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. Sweet is the lore which Nature brings; Our meddling intellect Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:-- We murder to dissect.

A \'Highland\' Boy!-why call him so?Because, my Darlings, ye must knowThat, under hills which rise like towers,Far higher hills than these of ours!He from his birth had lived.He ne\'er had seen one earthly sightThe sun, the day; the stars, the night;Or tree, or butterfly, or flower,Or fish in stream, or bird in bower,Or woman, man, or child. And yet he neither drooped nor pined,Nor had a melancholy mind;For God took pity on the Boy,And was his friend; and gave him joyOf which we nothing know.His Mother, too, no doubt, aboveHer other children him did love:For, was she here, or was she there,She thought of him with constant care,And more than mother\'s love. And proud she was of heart, when, cladIn crimson stockings, tartan plaid,And bonnet with a feather gay,To Kirk he on the Sabbath dayWent hand in hand with her.A dog too, had he; not for need,But one to play with and to feed;Which would have led him, if bereftOf company or friends, and leftWithout a better guide. And then the bagpipes he could blow-And thus from house to house would go;And all were pleased to hear and see,For none made sweeter melodyThan did the poor blind Boy.Yet he had many a restless dream;Both when he heard the eagles scream,And when he heard the torrents roar,And heard the water beat the shoreNear which their cottage stood. Beside a lake their cottage stood,Not small like ours, a peaceful flood;But one of mighty size, and strange;That, rough or smooth, is full of change,And stirring in its bed.For to this lake, by night and day,The great Sea-water finds its wayThrough long, long windings of the hillsAnd drinks up all the pretty rillsAnd rivers large and strong: Then hurries back the road it came-Returns, on errand still the same;This did it when the earth was new;And this for evermore will doAs long as earth shall last.And, with the coming of the tide,Come boats and ships that safely rideBetween the woods and lofty rocks;And to the shepherds with their flocksBring tales of distant lands. And of those tales, whate\'er they were,The blind Boy always had his share;Whether of mighty towns, or valesWith warmer suns and softer gales,Or wonders of the Deep.Yet more it pleased him, more it stirred,When from the water-side he heardThe shouting, and the jolly cheers;The bustle of the marinersIn stillness or in storm. But what do his desires avail?For He must never handle sail;Nor mount the mast, nor row, nor floatIll sailor\'s ship, or fisher\'s boat,Upon the rocking waves.His Mother often thought, and said,What sin would be upon her headIf she should suffer this: \'My Son,Whate\'er you do, leave this undone;The danger is so great.\' Thus lived he by Loch Leven\'s sideStill sounding with the sounding tide,And heard the billows leap and dance,Without a shadow of mischance,Till he was ten years old.When one day (and now mark me well,Ye soon shall know how this befell)He in a vessel of his own,On the swift flood is hurrying down,Down to the mighty Sea. In such a vessel never moreMay human creature leave the shore!If this or that way he should stir,Woe to the poor blind Mariner!For death will be his doom.But say what bears him?-Ye have seenThe Indian\'s bow, his arrows keen,Rare beasts, and birds with plumage bright;Gifts which, for wonder or delight,Are brought in ships from far. Such gifts had those seafaring menSpread round that haven in the glen;Each hut, perchance, might have its own;And to the Boy they all were known-He knew and prized them all.The rarest was a Turtle-shellWhich he, poor Child, had studied well;A shell of ample size, and lightAs the pearly car of Amphitrite,That sportive dolphins drew. And, as a Coracle that bravesOn Vaga\'s breast the fretful waves,This shell upon the deep would swim,And gaily lift its fearless brimAbove the tossing surge.And this the little blind Boy knew:And he a story strange yet trueHad heard, how in a shell like thisAn English Boy, O thought of bliss!Had stoutly launched from shore; Launched from the margin of a bayAmong the Indian isles, where layHis father\'s ship, and had sailed far-To join that gallant ship of war,In his delightful shell.Our Highland Boy oft visitedThe house that held this prize; and, ledBy choice or chance, did thither comeOne day when no one was at home,And found the door unbarred. While there he sate, alone and blind,That story flashed upon his mind;-A bold thought roused him, and he tookThe shell from out its secret nook,And bore it on his head.He launched his vessel,-and in prideOf spirit, from Loch Leven\'s side,Stepped into it-his thoughts all freeAs the light breezes that with gleeSang through the adventurer\'s hair. A while he stood upon his feet;He felt the motion-took his seat;Still better pleased as more and moreThe tide retreated from the shore,And sucked, and sucked him in.And there he is in face of Heaven.How rapidly the Child is driven!The fourth part of a mile, I ween,He thus had gone, ere he was seenBy any human eye. But when he was first seen, oh meWhat shrieking and what misery!For many saw; among the restHis Mother, she who loved him best,She saw her poor blind Boy.But for the child, the sightless Boy,It is the triumph of his joy!The bravest traveller in balloon,Mounting as if to reach the moon,Was never half so blessed. And let him, let him go his way,Alone, and innocent, and gay!For, if good Angels love to waitOn the forlorn unfortunate,This Child will take no harm.But now the passionate lament,Which from the crowd on shore was sent,The cries which broke from old and youngIn Gaelic, or the English tongue,Are stifled-all is still. And quickly with a silent crewA boat is ready to pursue;And from the shore their course they take,And swiftly down the running lakeThey follow the blind Boy.But soon they move with softer pace;So have ye seen the fowler chaseOn Grasmere\'s clear unruffled breastA youngling of the wild-duck\'s nestWith deftly-lifted oar; Or as the wily sailors creptTo seize (while on the Deep it slept)The hapless creature which did dwellErewhile within the dancing shell,They steal upon their prey.With sound the least that can be made,They follow, more and more afraid,More cautious as they draw more near;But in his darkness he can hear,And guesses their intent. \'Lei-gha-Lei-gha\'-he then cried out,\'Lei-gha-Lei-gha\'-with eager shout;Thus did he cry, and thus did pray,And what he meant was, \'Keep away,And leave me to myself!\'Alas! and when he felt their hands--You\'ve often heard of magic wands,That with a motion overthrowA palace of the proudest show,Or melt it into air: So all his dreams-that inward lightWith which his soul had shone so bright-All vanished;-\'twas a heartfelt crossTo him, a heavy, bitter loss,As he had ever known.But hark! a gratulating voice,With which the very hills rejoice:\'Tis from the crowd, who tremblinglyHave watched the event, and now can seeThat he is safe at last. And then, when he was brought to land,Full sure they were a happy band,Which, gathering round, did on the banksOf that great Water give God thanks,And welcomed the poor Child.And in the general joy of heartThe blind Boy\'s little dog took part;He leapt about, and oft did kissHis master\'s hands in sign of bliss,With sound like lamentation. But most of all, his Mother dear,She who had fainted with her fear,Rejoiced when waking she espiesThe Child; when she can trust her eyes,And touches the blind Boy.She led him home, and wept amain,When he was in the house again:Tears flowed in torrents from her eyes;She kissed him-how could she chastise?She was too happy far. Thus, after he had fondly bravedThe perilous Deep, the Boy was saved;And, though his fancies had been wild,Yet he was pleased and reconciledTo live in peace on shore.And in the lonely Highland dellStill do they keep the Turtle-shellAnd long the story will repeatOf the blind Boy\'s adventurous feat,And how he was preserved.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBook Sixth [cambridge And The Alps]\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE leaves were fading when to Esthwaite\'s banksAnd the simplicities of cottage lifeI bade farewell; and, one among the youthWho, summoned by that season, reuniteAs scattered birds troop to the fowler\'s lure,Went back to Granta\'s cloisters, not so promptOr eager, though as gay and undepressedIn mind, as when I thence had taken flightA few short months before. I turned my faceWithout repining from the coves and heights Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern;Quitted, not loth, the mild magnificenceOf calmer lakes and louder streams; and you,Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,Relinquished, and your nights of revelry,And in my own unlovely cell sate downIn lightsome mood--such privilege has youthThat cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts.The bonds of indolent society Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I livedMore to myself. Two winters may be passedWithout a separate notice: many booksWere skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,But with no settled plan. I was detachedInternally from academic cares;Yet independent study seemed a courseOf hardy disobedience toward friendsAnd kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.This spurious virtue, rather let it bear A name it now deserves, this cowardice,Gave treacherous sanction to that over-loveOf freedom which encouraged me to turnFrom regulations even of my ownAs from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell--Who knows what thus may have been gained, both thenAnd at a later season, or preserved;What love of nature, what original strengthOf contemplation, what intuitive truthsThe deepest and the best, what keen research, Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?The Poet\'s soul was with me at that time;Sweet meditations, the still overflowOf present happiness, while future yearsLacked not anticipations, tender dreams,No few of which have since been realised;And some remain, hopes for my future life.Four years and thirty, told this very week,Have I been now a sojourner on earth,By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me Life\'s morning radiance hath not left the hills,Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the daysWhich also first emboldened me to trustWith firmness, hitherto but slightly touchedBy such a daring thought, that I might leaveSome monument behind me which pure heartsShould reverence. The instinctive humbleness,Maintained even by the very name and thoughtOf printed books and authorship, beganTo melt away; and further, the dread awe Of mighty names was softened down and seemedApproachable, admitting fellowshipOf modest sympathy. Such aspect now,Though not familiarly, my mind put on,Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.All winter long, whenever free to choose,Did I by night frequent the College groveAnd tributary walks; the last, and oftThe only one, who had been lingering thereThrough hours of silence, till the porter\'s bell, A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice;Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,Inviting shades of opportune recess,Bestowed composure on a neighbourhoodUnpeaceful in itself. A single treeWith sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,Grew there; an ash which Winter for himselfDecked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:Up from the ground, and almost to the top, The trunk and every master branch were greenWith clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigsAnd outer spray profusely tipped with seedsThat hung in yellow tassels, while the airStirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stoodFoot-bound uplooking at this lovely treeBeneath a frosty moon. The hemisphereOf magic fiction, verse of mine perchanceMay never tread; but scarcely Spenser\'s selfCould have more tranquil visions in his youth, Or could more bright appearances createOf human forms with superhuman powers,Than I beheld, loitering on calm clear nightsAlone, beneath this fairy work of earth.On the vague reading of a truant youth\'Twere idle to descant. My inner judgmentNot seldom differed from my taste in books,As if it appertained to another mind,And yet the books which then I valued mostAre dearest to me \'now\'; for, having scanned, Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the formsOf Nature, in that knowledge I possessedA standard, often usefully applied,Even when unconsciously, to things removedFrom a familiar sympathy.--In fine,I was a better judge of thoughts than words,Misled in estimating words, not onlyBy common inexperience of youth,But by the trade in classic niceties,The dangerous craft, of culling term and phrase From languages that want the living voiceTo carry meaning to the natural heart;To tell us what is passion, what is truth,What reason, what simplicity and sense.Yet may we not entirely overlookThe pleasure gathered from the rudimentsOf geometric science. Though advancedIn these enquiries, with regret I speak,No farther than the threshold, there I foundBoth elevation and composed delight: With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleasedWith its own struggles, did I meditateOn the relation those abstractions bearTo Nature\'s laws, and by what process led,Those immaterial agents bowed their headsDuly to serve the mind of earth-born man;From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,From system on to system without end.More frequently from the same source I drewA pleasure quiet and profound, a sense Of permanent and universal sway,And paramount belief; there, recognisedA type, for finite natures, of the oneSupreme Existence, the surpassing lifeWhich--to the boundaries of space and time,Of melancholy space and doleful time,Superior and incapable of change,Nor touched by welterings of passion--is,And hath the name of, God. Transcendent peaceAnd silence did await upon these thoughts That were a frequent comfort to my youth.\'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,With fellow-sufferers by the shipwreck spared,Upon a desert coast, that having broughtTo land a single volume, saved by chance,A treatise of Geometry, he wont,Although of food and clothing destitute,And beyond common wretchedness depressed,To part from company and take this book(Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths) To spots remote, and draw his diagramsWith a long staff upon the sand, and thusDid oft beguile his sorrow, and almostForget his feeling: so (if like effectFrom the same cause produced, \'mid outward thingsSo different, may rightly be compared),So was it then with me, and so will beWith Poets ever. Mighty is the charmOf those abstractions to a mind besetWith images and haunted by herself, And specially delightful unto meWas that clear synthesis built up aloftSo gracefully; even then when it appearedNot more than a mere plaything, or a toyTo sense embodied: not the thing it isIn verity, an independent world,Created out of pure intelligence.Such dispositions then were mine unearnedBy aught, I fear, of genuine desert--Mine, through heaven\'s grace and inborn aptitudes. And not to leave the story of that timeImperfect, with these habits must be joined,Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that lovedA pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring;A treasured and luxurious gloom of choiceAnd inclination mainly, and the mereRedundancy of youth\'s contentedness.--To time thus spent, add multitudes of hoursPilfered away, by what the Bard who sang Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called\'Good-natured lounging,\' and behold a mapOf my collegiate life--far less intenseThan duty called for, or, without regardTo duty, \'might\' have sprung up of itselfBy change of accidents, or even, to speakWithout unkindness, in another place.Yet why take refuge in that plea?--the fault,This I repeat, was mine; mine be the blame.In summer, making quest for works of art, Or scenes renowned for beauty, I exploredThat streamlet whose blue current works its wayBetween romantic Dovedale\'s spiry rocks;Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden tractsOf my own native region, and was blestBetween these sundry wanderings with a joyAbove all joys, that seemed another mornRisen on mid noon; blest with the presence, FriendOf that sole Sister, her who hath been longDear to thee also, thy true friend and mine, Now, after separation desolate,Restored to me--such absence that she seemedA gift then first bestowed. The varied banksOf Emont, hitherto unnamed in song,And that monastic castle, \'mid tall trees,Low standing by the margin of the stream,A mansion visited (as fame reports)By Sidney, where, in sight of our Helvellyn,Or stormy Cross-fell, snatches he might penOf his Arcadia, by fraternal love Inspired;--that river and those mouldering towersHave seen us side by side, when, having clombThe darksome windings of a broken stair,And crept along a ridge of fractured wall,Not without trembling, we in safety lookedForth, through some Gothic window\'s open space,And gathered with one mind a rich rewardFrom the far-stretching landscape, by the lightOf morning beautified, or purple eve;Or, not less pleased, lay on some turret\'s head, Catching from tufts of grass and hare-bell flowersTheir faintest whisper to the passing breeze,Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.Another maid there was, who also shedA gladness o\'er that season, then to me,By her exulting outside look of youthAnd placid under-countenance, first endeared;That other spirit, Coleridge! who is nowSo near to us, that meek confiding heart,So reverenced by us both. O\'er paths and fields In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanesOf eglantine, and through the shady woods,And o\'er the Border Beacon, and the wasteOf naked pools, and common crags that layExposed on the bare fell, were scattered love,The spirit of pleasure, and youth\'s golden gleam.O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,And yet a power is on me, and a strongConfusion, and I seem to plant thee there.Far art thou wandered now in search of health And milder breezes,--melancholy lot!But thou art with us, with us in the past,The present, with us in the times to come.There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,No languor, no dejection, no dismay,No absence scarcely can there be, for thoseWho love as we do. Speed thee well! divideWith us thy pleasure; thy returning strength,Receive it daily as a joy of ours;Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift Of gales Etesian or of tender thoughts.I, too, have been a wanderer; but, alas!How different the fate of different men.Though mutually unknown, yea nursed and rearedAs if in several elements, we were framedTo bend at last to the same discipline,Predestined, if two beings ever were,To seek the same delights, and have one health,One happiness. Throughout this narrative,Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind For whom it registers the birth, and marks the growth,Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,And joyous loves, that hallow innocent daysOf peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,And groves I speak to thee, my Friend! to thee,Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depthsOf the huge city, on the leaded roofOf that wide edifice, thy school and home,Wert used to lie and gaze upon the cloudsMoving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired, To shut thine eyes, and by internal lightSee trees, and meadows, and thy native stream,Far distant, thus beheld from year to yearOf a long exile. Nor could I forget,In this late portion of my argument,That scarcely, as my term of pupilageCeased, had I left those academic bowersWhen thou wert thither guided. From the heartOf London, and from cloisters there, thou camest.And didst sit down in temperance and peace, A rigorous student. What a stormy courseThen followed. Oh! it is a pang that callsFor utterance, to think what easy changeOf circumstances might to thee have sparedA world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,For ever withered. Through this retrospectOf my collegiate life I still have hadThy after-sojourn in the self-same placePresent before my eyes, have played with timesAnd accidents as children do with cards, Or as a man, who, when his house is built,A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,Rebuild it to his liking. I have thoughtOf thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruseAmong the schoolmen, and Platonic formsOf wild ideal pageantry, shaped outFrom things well-matched or ill, and words for things, The self-created sustenance of a mindDebarred from Nature\'s living images,Compelled to be a life unto herself,And unrelentingly possessed by thirstOf greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,Ah! surely not in singleness of heartShould I have seen the light of evening fadeFrom smooth Cam\'s silent waters: had we met,Even at that early time, needs must I trustIn the belief, that my maturer age, My calmer habits, and more steady voice,Would with an influence benign have soothed,Or chased away, the airy wretchednessThat battened on thy youth. But thou hast trodA march of glory, which doth put to shameThese vain regrets; health suffers in thee, elseSuch grief for thee would be the weakest thoughtThat ever harboured in the breast of man.A passing word erewhile did lightly touchOn wanderings of my own, that now embraced With livelier hope a region wider far.When the third summer freed us from restraint,A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer,Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,Bound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight,Did this unprecedented course imply,Of college studies and their set rewards;Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by meWithout uneasy forethought of the pain, The censures, and ill-omening, of thoseTo whom my worldly interests were dear.But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,Had given a charter to irregular hopes.In any age of uneventful calmAmong the nations, surely would my heartHave been possessed by similar desire;But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,France standing on the top of golden hours, And human nature seeming born again.Lightly equipped, and but a few brief looksCast on the white cliffs of our native shoreFrom the receding vessel\'s deck, we chancedTo land at Calais on the very eveOf that great federal day; and there we saw,In a mean city, and among a few,How bright a face is worn when joy of oneIs joy for tens of millions. Southward thenceWe held our way, direct through hamlets, towns, Gaudy with reliques of that festival,Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,And window-garlands. On the public roads,And, once, three days successively, through pathsBy which our toilsome journey was abridged,Among sequestered villages we walkedAnd found benevolence and blessednessSpread like a fragrance everywhere, when springHath left no corner of the land untouched;Where elms for many and many a league in files With their thin umbrage, on the stately roadsOf that great kingdom, rustled o\'er our heads,For ever near us as we paced along:How sweet at such a time, with such delightOn every side, in prime of youthful strength,To feed a Poet\'s tender melancholyAnd fond conceit of sadness, with the soundOf undulations varying as might pleaseThe wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw Dances of liberty, and, in late hoursOf darkness, dances in the open airDeftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers onMight waste their breath in chiding.Under hills--The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,Upon the bosom of the gentle SaoneWe glided forward with the flowing stream.Swift Rhone! thou wert the \'wings\' on which we cutA winding passage with majestic easeBetween thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show Those woods and farms and orchards did present,And single cottages and lurking towns,Reach after reach, succession without endOf deep and stately vales! A lonely pairOf strangers, till day closed, we sailed alongClustered together with a merry crowdOf those emancipated, a blithe hostOf travellers, chiefly delegates, returningFrom the great spousals newly solemnisedAt their chief city, in the sight of Heaven. Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,And with their swords flourished as if to fightThe saucy air. In this proud companyWe landed--took with them our evening meal,Guests welcome almost as the angels wereTo Abraham of old. The supper done,With flowing cups elate and happy thoughtsWe rose at signal given, and formed a ringAnd, hand in hand, danced round and round the board; All hearts were open, every tongue was loudWith amity and glee; we bore a nameHonoured in France, the name of Englishmen,And hospitably did they give us hail,As their forerunners in a glorious course;And round and round the board we danced again.With these blithe friends our voyage we renewedAt early dawn. The monastery bellsMade a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;The rapid river flowing without noise, And each uprising or receding spireSpake with a sense of peace, at intervalsTouching the heart amid the boisterous crewBy whom we were encompassed. Taking leaveOf this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursuedOur journey, and ere twice the sun had setBeheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and thereRested within an awful \'solitude\':Yes, for even then no other than a place Of soul-affecting \'solitude\' appearedThat far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,As toward the sacred mansion we advanced,Arms flashing, and a military glareOf riotous men commissioned to expelThe blameless inmates, and belike subvertThat frame of social being, which so longHad bodied forth the ghostliness of thingsIn silence visible and perpetual calm.--\'Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!\'--The voice Was Nature\'s, uttered from her Alpine throne;I heard it then and seem to hear it now--\'Your impious work forbear, perish what may,Let this one temple last, be this one spotOf earth devoted to eternity!\'She ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno\'s pinesWaved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,And while below, along their several beds,Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death,Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart Responded; \'Honour to the patriot\'s zeal!Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!Hail to the mighty projects of the time!Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thouGo forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,Fanned by the breath of angry Providence.But oh! if Past and Future be the wingsOn whose support harmoniously conjoinedMoves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare These courts of mystery, where a step advancedBetween the portals of the shadowy rocksLeaves far behind life\'s treacherous vanities,For penitential tears and trembling hopesExchanged--to equalise in God\'s pure sightMonarch and peasant: be the house redeemedWith its unworldly votaries, for the sakeOf conquest over sense, hourly achievedThrough faith and meditative reason, restingUpon the word of heaven-imparted truth, Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claimOf that imaginative impulse sentFrom these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,The untransmuted shapes of many worlds,Cerulean ether\'s pure inhabitants,These forests unapproachable by death,That shall endure as long as man endures,To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,To struggle, to be lost within himselfIn trepidation, from the blank abyss To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled.\'Not seldom since that moment have I wishedThat thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calmHadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,In sympathetic reverence we trodThe floors of those dim cloisters, till that hour,From their foundation, strangers to the presenceOf unrestricted and unthinking man.Abroad, how cheeringly the sunshine layUpon the open lawns! Vallombre\'s groves Entering, we fed the soul with darkness; thenceIssued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,In different quarters of the bending sky,The cross of Jesus stand erect, as ifHands of angelic powers had fixed it there,Memorial reverenced by a thousand storms;Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweepAnd rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.\'Tis not my present purpose to retraceThat variegated journey step by step. A march it was of military speed,And Earth did change her images and formsBefore us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.Day after day, up early and down late,From hill to vale we dropped, from vale to hillMounted--from province on to province swept,Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,Eager as birds of prey, or as a shipUpon the stretch, when winds are blowing fair:Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life, Enticing valleys, greeted them and leftToo soon, while yet the very flash and gleamOf salutation were not passed away.Oh! sorrow for the youth who could have seen,Unchastened, unsubdued, unawed, unraisedTo patriarchal dignity of mind,And pure simplicity of wish and will,Those sanctified abodes of peaceful man,Pleased (though to hardship born, and compassed roundWith danger, varying as the seasons change), Pleased with his daily task, or, if not pleased,Contented, from the moment that the dawn(Ah! surely not without attendant gleamsOf soul-illumination) calls him forthTo industry, by glistenings flung on rocks,Whose evening shadows lead him to repose.Well might a stranger look with bounding heartDown on a green recess, the first I sawOf those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,Quiet and lorded over and possessed By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tentsOr Indian cabins over the fresh lawnsAnd by the river side.That very day,From a bare ridge we also first beheldUnveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grievedTo have a soulless image on the eyeThat had usurped upon a living thoughtThat never more could be. The wondrous ValeOf Chamouny stretched far below, and soonWith its dumb cataracts and streams of ice, A motionless array of mighty waves,Five rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,And reconciled us to realities;There small birds warble from the leafy trees,The eagle soars high in the element,There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,Descending from the mountain to make sportAmong the cottages by beds of flowers. Whate\'er in this wide circuit we beheld,Or heard, was fitted to our unripe stateOf intellect and heart. With such a bookBefore our eyes, we could not choose but readLessons of genuine brotherhood, the plainAnd universal reason of mankind,The truths of young and old. Nor, side by sidePacing, two social pilgrims, or aloneEach with his humour, could we fail to aboundIn dreams and fictions, pensively composed: Dejection taken up for pleasure\'s sake,And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,And sober posies of funereal flowers,Gathered among those solitudes sublimeFrom formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,Did sweeten many a meditative hour.Yet still in me with those soft luxuriesMixed something of stern mood, an underthirstOf vigour seldom utterly allayed:And from that source how different a sadness Would issue, let one incident make known.When from the Vallais we had turned, and clombAlong the Simplon\'s steep and rugged road,Following a band of muleteers, we reachedA halting-place, where all together tookTheir noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,Then paced the beaten downward way that ledRight to a rough stream\'s edge, and there broke off;The only track now visible was one That from the torrent\'s further brink held forthConspicuous invitation to ascendA lofty mountain. After brief delayCrossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fearsIntruded, for we failed to overtakeOur comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,While every moment added doubt to doubt,A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learnedThat to the spot which had perplexed us first We must descend, and there should find the road,Which in the stony channel of the streamLay a few steps, and then along its banks;And, that our future course, all plain to sight,Was downwards, with the current of that stream.Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,We questioned him again, and yet again;But every word that from the peasant\'s lipsCame in reply, translated by our feelings, Ended in this,--\'that we had crossed the Alps\'.Imagination--here the Power so calledThrough sad incompetence of human speech,That awful Power rose from the mind\'s abyssLike an unfathered vapour that enwraps,At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;Halted without an effort to break through;But to my conscious soul I now can say--\'I recognise thy glory:\' in such strengthOf usurpation, when the light of sense Goes out, but with a flash that has revealedThe invisible world, doth greatness make abode,There harbours; whether we be young or old,Our destiny, our being\'s heart and home,Is with infinitude, and only there;With hope it is, hope that can never die,Effort, and expectation, and desire,And something evermore about to be.Under such banners militant, the soulSeeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughtsThat are their own perfection and reward,Strong in herself and in beatitudeThat hides her, like the mighty flood of NilePoured from his fount of Abyssinian cloudsTo fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.The melancholy slackening that ensuedUpon those tidings by the peasant givenWas soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed, Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and roadWere fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait,And with them did we journey several hoursAt a slow pace. The immeasurable heightOf woods decaying, never to be decayed,The stationary blasts of waterfalls,And in the narrow rent at every turnWinds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,The rocks that muttered close upon our ears, Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-sideAs if a voice were in them, the sick sightAnd giddy prospect of the raving stream,The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--Were all like workings of one mind, the featuresOf the same face, blossoms upon one tree;Characters of the great Apocalypse,The types and symbols of Eternity,Of first, and last, and midst, and without end. That night our lodging was a house that stoodAlone within the valley, at a pointWhere, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelledThe rapid stream whose margin we had trod;A dreary mansion, large beyond all need,With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunnedBy noise of waters, making innocent sleepLie melancholy among weary bones.Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified Into a lordly river, broad and deep,Dimpling along in silent majesty,With mountains for its neighbours, and in viewOf distant mountains and their snowy tops,And thus proceeding to Locarno\'s Lake,Fit resting-place for such a visitant.Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,Bask in the sunshine of the memory;And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth Keeps to herself, confined as in a depthOf Abyssinian privacy. I spakeOf thee, thy chestnut woods, and garden plotsOf Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,Winding from house to house, from town to town,Sole link that binds them to each other; walks,League after league, and cloistral avenues,Where silence dwells if music be not there:While yet a youth undisciplined in verse, Through fond ambition of that hour I stroveTo chant your praise; nor can approach you nowUngreeted by a more melodious Song,Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned ArtMay flow in lasting current. Like a breezeOr sunbeam over your domain I passedIn motion without pause; but ye have leftYour beauty with me, a serene accordOf forms and colours, passive, yet endowedIn their submissiveness with power as sweet And gracious, almost, might I dare to say,As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,Or the remembrance of a generous deed,Or mildest visitations of pure thought,When God, the giver of all joy, is thankedReligiously, in silent blessedness;Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.With those delightful pathways we advanced,For two days\' space, in presence of the Lake,That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed A character more stern. The second night,From sleep awakened, and misled by soundOf the church clock telling the hours with strokesWhose import then we had not learned, we roseBy moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,Along the winding margin of the lake,Led, as before, we should behold the sceneHushed in profound repose. We left the townOf Gravedona with this hope; but soon Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.An open place it was, and overlooked,From high, the sullen water far beneath,On which a dull red image of the moonLay bedded, changing oftentimes its formLike an uneasy snake. From hour to hourWe sate and sate, wondering, as if the nightHad been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rockAt last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep, But \'could not\' sleep, tormented by the stingsOf insects, which, with noise like that of noon,Filled all the woods: the cry of unknown birds;The mountains more by blackness visibleAnd their own size, than any outward light;The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clockThat told, with unintelligible voice,The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,That did not leave us free from personal fear; And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that setBefore us, while she still was high in heaven;--These were our food; and such a summer\'s nightFollowed that pair of golden days that shedOn Como\'s Lake, and all that round it lay,Their fairest, softest, happiest influence.But here I must break off, and bid farewellTo days, each offering some new sight, or fraughtWith some untried adventure, in a courseProlonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow Checked our unwearied steps. Let this aloneBe mentioned as a parting word, that notIn hollow exultation, dealing outHyperboles of praise comparative,Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mindHerself were nothing, a mere pensionerOn outward forms--did we in presence standOf that magnificent region. On the frontOf this whole Song is written that my heart Must, in such Temple, needs have offered upA different worship. Finally, whate\'erI saw, or heard, or felt, was but a streamThat flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,Confederate with the current of the soul,To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,In its degree of power, administeredTo grandeur or to tenderness,--to the oneDirectly, but to tender thoughts by meansLess often instantaneous in effect; Led me to these by paths that, in the main,Were more circuitous, but not less sureDuly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.Oh, most beloved Friend! a glorious time,A happy time that was; triumphant looksWere then the common language of all eyes;As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailedTheir great expectancy: the fife of warWas then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,A blackbird\'s whistle in a budding grove. We left the Swiss exulting in the fateOf their near neighbours; and, when shortening fastOur pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,We crossed the Brabant armies on the fretFor battle in the cause of Liberty.A stripling, scarcely of the household thenOf social life, I looked upon these thingsAs from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,Was touched, but with no intimate concern;I seemed to move along them, as a bird Moves through the air, or as a fish pursuesIts sport, or feeds in its proper element;I wanted not that joy, I did not needSuch help; the ever-living universe,Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,And the independent spirit of pure youthCalled forth, at every season, new delights,Spread round my steps like sunshine o\'er green fields.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nComposed After A Journey Across The Hambleton Hills, Yorkshire\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDARK and more dark the shades of evening fell;The wished-for point was reached--but at an hourWhen little could be gained from that rich dowerOf prospect, whereof many thousands tell.Yet did the glowing west with marvellous powerSalute us; there stood Indian citadel,Temple of Greece, and minster with its towerSubstantially expressed--a place for bellOr clock to toll from! Many a tempting isle,With groves that never were imagined, lay \'Mid seas how steadfast! objects all for the eyeOf silent rapture; but we felt the whileWe should forget them; they are of the sky,And from our earthly memory fade away.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOde To Lycoris.  May 1817\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIAN age hath been when Earth was proudOf lustre too intenseTo be sustained; and Mortals bowedThe front in self-defence.Who \'then\', if Dian\'s crescent gleamed,Or Cupid\'s sparkling arrow streamedWhile on the wing the Urchin played,Could fearlessly approach the shade?--Enough for one soft vernal day,If I, a bard of ebbing time,And nurtured in a fickle clime,May haunt this horned bay;Whose amorous water multipliesThe flitting halcyon\'s vivid dyes;And smooths her liquid breast--to showThese swan-like specks of mountain snow,White as the pair that slid along the plainsOf heaven, when Venus held the reins!IIIn youth we love the darksome lawnBrushed by the owlet\'s wing;Then, Twilight is preferred to Dawn,And Autumn to the Spring.Sad fancies do we then affect,In luxury of disrespectTo our own prodigal excessOf too familiar happiness.Lycoris (if such name befitThee, thee my life\'s celestial sign!)When Nature marks the year\'s decline,Be ours to welcome it;Pleased with the harvest hope that runsBefore the path of milder suns;Pleased while the sylvan world displaysIts ripeness to the feeding gaze;Pleased when the sullen winds resound the knellOf the resplendent miracle.IIIBut something whispers to my heartThat, as we downward tend,Lycoris! life requires an \'art\'To which our souls must bend;A skill--to balance and supply;And, ere the flowing fount be dry,As soon it must, a sense to sip,Or drink, with no fastidious lip.Then welcome, above all, the GuestWhose smiles, diffused o\'er land and sea,Seem to recall the DeityOf youth into the breast:May pensive Autumn ne\'er presentA claim to her disparagement!While blossoms and the budding sprayInspire us in our own decay;Still, as we nearer draw to life\'s dark goal,Be hopeful Spring the favourite of the Soul!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBook Fourteenth [conclusion]\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIn one of those excursions (may they ne\'erFade from remembrance!) through the Northern tractsOf Cambria ranging with a youthful friend,I left Bethgelert\'s huts at couching-time,And westward took my way, to see the sunRise, from the top of Snowdon. To the doorOf a rude cottage at the mountain\'s baseWe came, and roused the shepherd who attendsThe adventurous stranger\'s steps, a trusty guide;Then, cheered by short refreshment, sallied forth. It was a close, warm, breezeless summer night,Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping fogLow-hung and thick that covered all the sky;But, undiscouraged, we began to climbThe mountain-side. The mist soon girt us round,And, after ordinary travellers\' talkWith our conductor, pensively we sankEach into commerce with his private thoughts:Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myselfWas nothing either seen or heard that checked Those musings or diverted, save that onceThe shepherd\'s lurcher, who, among the crags,Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teasedHis coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.This small adventure, for even such it seemedIn that wild place and at the dead of night,Being over and forgotten, on we woundIn silence as before. With forehead bentEarthward, as if in opposition setAgainst an enemy, I panted up With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,Ascending at loose distance each from each,And I, as chanced, the foremost of the band;When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,And with a step or two seemed brighter still;Nor was time given to ask or learn the cause,For instantly a light upon the turfFell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,The Moon hung naked in a firmament Of azure without cloud, and at my feetRested a silent sea of hoary mist.A hundred hills their dusky backs upheavedAll over this still ocean; and beyond,Far, far beyond, the solid vapours stretched,In headlands, tongues, and promontory shapes,Into the main Atlantic, that appearedTo dwindle, and give up his majesty,Usurped upon far as the sight could reach.Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none Was there, nor loss; only the inferior starsHad disappeared, or shed a fainter lightIn the clear presence of the full-orbed Moon,Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazedUpon the billowy ocean, as it layAll meek and silent, save that through a rift--Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,A fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place--Mounted the roar of waters, torrents, streamsInnumerable, roaring with one voice! Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,For so it seemed, felt by the starry heavens.When into air had partially dissolvedThat vision, given to spirits of the nightAnd three chance human wanderers, in calm thoughtReflected, it appeared to me the typeOf a majestic intellect, its actsAnd its possessions, what it has and craves,What in itself it is, and would become.There I beheld the emblem of a mind That feeds upon infinity, that broodsOver the dark abyss, intent to hearIts voices issuing forth to silent lightIn one continuous stream; a mind sustainedBy recognitions of transcendent power,In sense conducting to ideal form,In soul of more than mortal privilege.One function, above all, of such a mindHad Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,\'Mid circumstances awful and sublime, That mutual domination which she lovesTo exert upon the face of outward things,So moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowedWith interchangeable supremacy,That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,And cannot choose but feel. The power, which allAcknowledge when thus moved, which Nature thusTo bodily sense exhibits, is the expressResemblance of that glorious facultyThat higher minds bear with them as their own. This is the very spirit in which they dealWith the whole compass of the universe:They from their native selves can send abroadKindred mutations; for themselves createA like existence; and, whene\'er it dawnsCreated for them, catch it, or are caughtBy its inevitable mastery,Like angels stopped upon the wing by soundOf harmony from Heaven\'s remotest spheres.Them the enduring and the transient both Serve to exalt; they build up greatest thingsFrom least suggestions; ever on the watch,Willing to work and to be wrought upon,They need not extraordinary callsTo rouse them; in a world of life they live,By sensible impressions not enthralled,But by their quickening impulse made more promptTo hold fit converse with the spiritual world,And with the generations of mankindSpread over time, past, present, and to come, Age after age, till Time shall be no more.Such minds are truly from the Deity,For they are Powers; and hence the highest blissThat flesh can know is theirs--the consciousnessOf Whom they are, habitually infusedThrough every image and through every thought,And all affections by communion raisedFrom earth to heaven, from human to divine;Hence endless occupation for the Soul,Whether discursive or intuitive; Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,Emotions which best foresight need not fear,Most worthy then of trust when most intense.Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that crushOur hearts--if here the words of Holy WritMay with fit reverence be applied--that peaceWhich passeth understanding, that reposeIn moral judgments which from this pure sourceMust come, or will by man be sought in vain.Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long Preserved, enlarged, this freedom in himself?For this alone is genuine liberty:Where is the favoured being who hath heldThat course unchecked, unerring, and untired,In one perpetual progress smooth and bright?--A humbler destiny have we retraced,And told of lapse and hesitating choice,And backward wanderings along thorny ways:Yet--compassed round by mountain solitudes,Within whose solemn temple I received My earliest visitations, careless thenOf what was given me; and which now I range,A meditative, oft a suffering, man--Do I declare--in accents which, from truthDeriving cheerful confidence, shall blendTheir modulation with these vocal streams--That, whatsoever falls my better mind,Revolving with the accidents of life,May have sustained, that, howsoe\'er misled,Never did I, in quest of right and wrong, Tamper with conscience from a private aim;Nor was in any public hope the dupeOf selfish passions; nor did ever yieldWilfully to mean cares or low pursuits,But shrunk with apprehensive jealousyFrom every combination which might aidThe tendency, too potent in itself,Of use and custom to bow down the soulUnder a growing weight of vulgar sense,And substitute a universe of death For that which moves with light and life informed,Actual, divine, and true. To fear and love,To love as prime and chief, for there fear ends,Be this ascribed; to early intercourse,In presence of sublime or beautiful forms,With the adverse principles of pain and joy--Evil as one is rashly named by menWho know not what they speak. By love subsistsAll lasting grandeur, by pervading love;That gone, we are as dust.--Behold the fields In balmy spring-time full of rising flowersAnd joyous creatures; see that pair, the lambAnd the lamb\'s mother, and their tender waysShall touch thee to the heart; thou callest this love,And not inaptly so, for love it is,Far as it carries thee. In some green bowerRest, and be not alone, but have thou thereThe One who is thy choice of all the world:There linger, listening, gazing, with delightImpassioned, but delight how pitiable! Unless this love by a still higher loveBe hallowed, love that breathes not without awe;Love that adores, but on the knees of prayer,By heaven inspired; that frees from chains the soul,Lifted, in union with the purest, best,Of earth-born passions, on the wings of praiseBearing a tribute to the Almighty\'s Throne.This spiritual Love acts not nor can existWithout Imagination, which, in truth,Is but another name for absolute power And clearest insight, amplitude of mind,And Reason in her most exalted mood.This faculty hath been the feeding sourceOf our long labour: we have traced the streamFrom the blind cavern whence is faintly heardIts natal murmur; followed it to lightAnd open day; accompanied its courseAmong the ways of Nature, for a timeLost sight of it bewildered and engulphed;Then given it greeting as it rose once more In strength, reflecting from its placid breastThe works of man and face of human life;And lastly, from its progress have we drawnFaith in life endless, the sustaining thoughtOf human Being, Eternity, and God.Imagination having been our theme,So also hath that intellectual Love,For they are each in each, and cannot standDividually.--Here must thou be, O Man!Power to thyself; no Helper hast thou here; Here keepest thou in singleness thy state:No other can divide with thee this work:No secondary hand can interveneTo fashion this ability; \'tis thine,The prime and vital principle is thineIn the recesses of thy nature, farFrom any reach of outward fellowship,Else is not thine at all. But joy to him,Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laidHere, the foundation of his future years! For all that friendship, all that love can do,All that a darling countenance can lookOr dear voice utter, to complete the man,Perfect him, made imperfect in himself,All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risenUp to the height of feeling intellectShall want no humbler tenderness; his heartBe tender as a nursing mother\'s heart;Of female softness shall his life be full,Of humble cares and delicate desires, Mild interests and gentlest sympathies.Child of my parents! Sister of my soul!Thanks in sincerest verse have been elsewherePoured out for all the early tendernessWhich I from thee imbibed: and \'tis most trueThat later seasons owed to thee no less;For, spite of thy sweet influence and the touchOf kindred hands that opened out the springsOf genial thought in childhood, and in spiteOf all that unassisted I had marked In life or nature of those charms minuteThat win their way into the heart by stealth(Still to the very going-out of youth)I too exclusively esteemed \'that\' love,And sought \'that\' beauty, which, as Milton sings,Hath terror in it. Thou didst soften downThis over-sternness; but for thee, dear Friend!My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had stoodIn her original self too confident,Retained too long a countenance severe; A rock with torrents roaring, with the cloudsFamiliar, and a favourite of the stars:But thou didst plant its crevices with flowers,Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the breeze,And teach the little birds to build their nestsAnd warble in its chambers. At a timeWhen Nature, destined to remain so longForemost in my affections, had fallen backInto a second place, pleased to becomeA handmaid to a nobler than herself, When every day brought with it some new senseOf exquisite regard for common things,And all the earth was budding with these giftsOf more refined humanity, thy breath,Dear Sister! was a kind of gentler springThat went before my steps. Thereafter cameOne whom with thee friendship had early paired;She came, no more a phantom to adornA moment, but an inmate of the heart,And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined To penetrate the lofty and the low;Even as one essence of pervading lightShines, in the brightest of ten thousand starsAnd the meek worm that feeds her lonely lampCouched in the dewy grass.With such a theme,Coleridge! with this my argument, of theeShall I be silent? O capacious Soul!Placed on this earth to love and understand,And from thy presence shed the light of love,Shall I be mute, ere thou be spoken of? Thy kindred influence to my heart of heartsDid also find its way. Thus fear relaxedHer overweening grasp; thus thoughts and thingsIn the self-haunting spirit learned to takeMore rational proportions; mystery,The incumbent mystery of sense and soul,Of life and death, time and eternity,Admitted more habitually a mildInterposition--a serene delightIn closelier gathering cares, such as become A human creature, howsoe\'er endowed,Poet, or destined for a humbler name;And so the deep enthusiastic joy,The rapture of the hallelujah sentFrom all that breathes and is, was chastened, stemmedAnd balanced by pathetic truth, by trustIn hopeful reason, leaning on the stayOf Providence; and in reverence for duty,Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and thereStrewing in peace life\'s humblest ground with herbs, At every season green, sweet at all hours.And now, O Friend! this history is broughtTo its appointed close: the disciplineAnd consummation of a Poet\'s mind,In everything that stood most prominent,Have faithfully been pictured; we have reachedThe time (our guiding object from the first)When we may, not presumptuously, I hope,Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and suchMy knowledge, as to make me capable Of building up a Work that shall endure.Yet much hath been omitted, as need was;Of books how much! and even of the other wealthThat is collected among woods and fields,Far more: for Nature\'s secondary graceHath hitherto been barely touched upon,The charm more superficial that attendsHer works, as they present to Fancy\'s choiceApt illustrations of the moral world,Caught at a glance, or traced with curious pains. Finally, and above all, O Friend! (I speakWith due regret) how much is overlookedIn human nature and her subtle ways,As studied first in our own hearts, and thenIn life among the passions of mankind,Varying their composition and their hue,Where\'er we move, under the diverse shapesThat individual character presentsTo an attentive eye. For progress meet,Along this intricate and difficult path, Whate\'er was wanting, something had I gained,As one of many schoolfellows compelled,In hardy independence, to stand upAmid conflicting interests, and the shockOf various tempers; to endure and noteWhat was not understood, though known to be;Among the mysteries of love and hate,Honour and shame, looking to right and left,Unchecked by innocence too delicate,And moral notions too intolerant, Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when calledTo take a station among men, the stepWas easier, the transition more secure,More profitable also; for, the mindLearns from such timely exercise to keepIn wholesome separation the two natures,The one that feels, the other that observes.Yet one word more of personal concern;--Since I withdrew unwillingly from France,I led an undomestic wanderer\'s life, In London chiefly harboured, whence I roamed,Tarrying at will in many a pleasant spotOf rural England\'s cultivated valesOr Cambrian solitudes. A youth--(he boreThe name of Calvert--it shall live, if wordsOf mine can give it life,) in firm beliefThat by endowments not from me withheldGood might be furthered--in his last decayBy a bequest sufficient for my needsEnabled me to pause for choice, and walk At large and unrestrained, nor damped too soonBy mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yetFar less a common follower of the world,He deemed that my pursuits and labours layApart from all that leads to wealth, or evenA necessary maintenance insures,Without some hazard to the finer sense;He cleared a passage for me, and the streamFlowed in the bent of Nature.Having nowTold what best merits mention, further pains Our present purpose seems not to require,And I have other tasks. Recall to mindThe mood in which this labour was begun,O Friend! The termination of my courseIs nearer now, much nearer; yet even then,In that distraction and intense desire,I said unto the life which I had lived,Where art thou? Hear I not a voice from theeWhich \'tis reproach to hear? Anon I roseAs if on wings, and saw beneath me stretched Vast prospect of the world which I had beenAnd was; and hence this Song, which, like a lark,I have protracted, in the unwearied heavensSinging, and often with more plaintive voiceTo earth attempered and her deep-drawn sighs,Yet centring all in love, and in the endAll gratulant, if rightly understood.Whether to me shall be allotted life,And, with life, power to accomplish aught of worth,That will be deemed no insufficient plea For having given the story of myself,Is all uncertain: but, beloved Friend!When, looking back, thou seest, in clearer viewThan any liveliest sight of yesterday,That summer, under whose indulgent skies,Upon smooth Quantock\'s airy ridge we rovedUnchecked, or loitered \'mid her sylvan combs,Thou in bewitching words, with happy heart,Didst chaunt the vision of that Ancient Man,The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes Didst utter of the Lady Christabel;And I, associate with such labour, steepedIn soft forgetfulness the livelong hours,Murmuring of him who, joyous hap, was found,After the perils of his moonlight ride,Near the loud waterfall; or her who sateIn misery near the miserable Thorn--When thou dost to that summer turn thy thoughts,And hast before thee all which then we were,To thee, in memory of that happiness, It will be known, by thee at least, my Friend!Felt, that the history of a Poet\'s mindIs labour not unworthy of regard;To thee the work shall justify itself.The last and later portions of this giftHave been prepared, not with the buoyant spiritsThat were our daily portion when we firstTogether wantoned in wild Poesy,But, under pressure of a private grief,Keen and enduring, which the mind and heart, That in this meditative historyHave been laid open, needs must make me feelMore deeply, yet enable me to bearMore firmly; and a comfort now hath risenFrom hope that thou art near, and wilt be soonRestored to us in renovated health;When, after the first mingling of our tears,\'Mong other consolations, we may drawSome pleasure from this offering of my love.Oh! yet a few short years of useful life, And all will be complete, thy race be run,Thy monument of glory will be raised;Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of truth)This age fall back to old idolatry,Though men return to servitude as fastAs the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame,By nations, sink together, we shall stillFind solace--knowing what we have learnt to know,Rich in true happiness if allowed to beFaithful alike in forwarding a day Of firmer trust, joint labourers in the work(Should Providence such grace to us vouchsafe)Of their deliverance, surely yet to come.Prophets of Nature, we to them will speakA lasting inspiration, sanctifiedBy reason, blest by faith: what we have loved,Others will love, and we will teach them how;Instruct them how the mind of man becomesA thousand times more beautiful than the earthOn which he dwells, above this frame of things (Which, \'mid all revolution in the hopesAnd fears of men, doth still remain unchanged)In beauty exalted, as it is itselfOf quality and fabric more divine.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPicture Of Daniel In The Lion\'s Den At Hamilton Palace\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAmid a fertile region green with woodAnd fresh with rivers, well doth it becomeThe Ducal Owner, in his Palace-homeTo naturalise this tawny Lion brood;Children of Art, that claim strange brotherhood,Couched in their Den, with those that roam at largeOver the burning wilderness, and chargeThe wind with terror while they roar for food.But theseare satiate, and a stillness drearCalls into life a more enduring fear;Yet is the Prophet calm, nor would the caveDaunt him - if his Companions, now bedrowsedYawning and listless, were by hunger roused:Man placed him here, and God, he knows, can save.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHail, Twilight, Sovereign Of One Peaceful Hour\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHAIL Twilight, sovereign of one peaceful hour!Not dull art Thou as undiscerning Night;But studious only to remove from sightDay\'s mutable distinctions.--Ancient Power!Thus did the waters gleam, the mountains lower,To the rude Briton, when, in wolf-skin vestHere roving wild, he laid him down to restOn the bare rock, or through a leafy bowerLooked ere his eyes were closed. By him was seenThe self-same Vision which we now behold; At thy meek bidding, shadowy Power! brought forthThese mighty barriers, and the gulf between;The flood, the stars,--a spectacle as oldAs the beginning of the heavens and earth!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNovember 1813\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNow that all hearts are glad, all faces bright,Our aged Sovereign sits, to the ebb and flowOf states and kingdoms, to their joy or woe,Insensible.

(Book V )\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHEN Contemplation, like the night-calm felt Through earth and sky, spreads widely, and sends deep Into the soul its tranquillising power, Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O Man, Earth\'s paramount Creature! not so much for woes That thou endurest; heavy though that weight be, Cloud-like it mounts, or touched with light divine Doth melt away; but for those palms achieved Through length of time, by patient exercise Of study and hard thought; there, there, it is That sadness finds its fuel. Hitherto, In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven As her prime teacher, intercourse with man Established by the sovereign Intellect, Who through that bodily image hath diffused, As might appear to the eye of fleeting time, A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought, For commerce of thy nature with herself, Things that aspire to unconquerable life; And yet we feel--we cannot choose but feel-- That they must perish. Tremblings of the heart It gives, to think that our immortal being No more shall need such garments; and yet man, As long as he shall be the child of earth, Might almost "weep to have" what he may lose, Nor be himself extinguished, but survive, Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate. A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,-- Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch Her pleasant habitations, and dry up Old Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare, Yet would the living Presence still subsist Victorious, and composure would ensue, And kindlings like the morning--presage sure Of day returning and of life revived. But all the meditations of mankind, Yea, all the adamantine holds of truth By reason built, or passion, which itself Is highest reason in a soul sublime; The consecrated works of Bard and Sage, Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men, Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes; Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the Mind Some element to stamp her image on In nature somewhat nearer to her own? Why, gifted with such powers to send abroad Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail? One day, when from my lips a like complaint Had fallen in presence of a studious friend, He with a smile made answer, that in truth \'Twas going far to seek disquietude; But on the front of his reproof confessed That he himself had oftentimes given way To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told, That once in the stillness of a summer\'s noon, While I was seated in a rocky cave By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced, The famous history of the errant knight Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughts Beset me, and to height unusual rose, While listlessly I sate, and, having closed The book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea. On poetry and geometric truth, And their high privilege of lasting life, From all internal injury exempt, I mused; upon these chiefly: and at length, My senses yielding to the sultry air, Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream. I saw before me stretched a boundless plain Of sandy wilderness, all black and void, And as I looked around, distress and fear Came creeping over me, when at my side, Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared Upon a dromedary, mounted high. He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes: A lance he bore, and underneath one arm A stone, and in the opposite hand a shell Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide Was present, one who with unerring skill Would through the desert lead me; and while yet I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight Which the new-comer carried through the waste Could mean, the Arab told me that the stone (To give it in the language of the dream) Was "Euclid\'s Elements," and "This," said he, "Is something of more worth;" and at the word Stretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape, In colour so resplendent, with command That I should hold it to my ear. I did so, And heard that instant in an unknown tongue, Which yet I understood, articulate sounds, A loud prophetic blast of harmony; An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold Destruction to the children of the earth By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased The song, than the Arab with calm look declared That all would come to pass of which the voice 0 Had given forewarning, and that he himself Was going then to bury those two books: The one that held acquaintance with the stars, And wedded soul to soul in purest bond Of reason, undisturbed by space or time; The other that was a god, yea many gods, Had voices more than all the winds, with power To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe, Through every clime, the heart of human kind. While this was uttering, strange as it may seem, I wondered not, although I plainly saw The one to be a stone, the other a shell; Nor doubted once but that they both were books, Having a perfect faith in all that passed. Far stronger, now, grew the desire I felt To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed To share his enterprise, he hurried on Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen, For oftentimes he cast a backward look, Grasping his twofold treasure.--Lance in rest, He rode, I keeping pace with him; and now He, to my fancy, had become the knight Whose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight, But was an Arab of the desert too; Of these was neither, and was both at once. His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed; And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyes Saw, over half the wilderness diffused, A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause: "It is," said he, "the waters of the deep Gathering upon us;" quickening then the pace Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode, He left me: I called after him aloud; He heeded not; but, with his twofold charge Still in his grasp, before me, full in view, Went hurrying o\'er the illimitable waste, With the fleet waters of a drowning world In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror, And saw the sea before me, and the book, In which I had been reading, at my side. Full often, taking from the world of sleep This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld, This semi-Quixote, I to him have given A substance, fancied him a living man, A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed By love and feeling, and internal thought Protracted among endless solitudes; Have shaped him wandering upon this quest! Nor have I pitied him; but rather felt Reverence was due to a being thus employed; And thought that, in the blind and awful lair Of such a madness, reason did lie couched. Enow there are on earth to take in charge Their wives, their children, and their virgin loves, Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear; Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say, Contemplating in soberness the approach Of an event so dire, by signs in earth Or heaven made manifest, that I could share That maniac\'s fond anxiety, and go Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least Me hath such strong entrancement overcome, When I have held a volume in my hand, Poor earthly casket of immortal verse, Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine! Great and benign, indeed, must be the power Of living nature, which could thus so long Detain me from the best of other guides And dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised, Even in the time of lisping infancy; And later down, in prattling childhood even, While I was travelling back among those days, How could I ever play an ingrate\'s part? Once more should I have made those bowers resound, By intermingling strains of thankfulness With their own thoughtless melodies; at least It might have well beseemed me to repeat Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again, In slender accents of sweet verse, some tale That did bewitch me then, and soothes me now. O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul, Think not that I could pass along untouched By these remembrances. Yet wherefore speak? Why call upon a few weak words to say What is already written in the hearts Of all that breathe?--what in the path of all Drops daily from the tongue of every child, Wherever man is found? The trickling tear Upon the cheek of listening Infancy Proclaims it, and the insuperable look That drinks as if it never could be full. That portion of my story I shall leave There registered: whatever else of power Or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be Peculiar to myself, let that remain Where still it works, though hidden from all search Among the depths of time. Yet is it just That here, in memory of all books which lay Their sure foundations in the heart of man, Whether by native prose, or numerous verse, 0 That in the name of all inspired souls-- From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voice That roars along the bed of Jewish song, And that more varied and elaborate, Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake Our shores in England,--from those loftiest notes Down to the low and wren-like warblings, made For cottagers and spinners at the wheel, And sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs, Stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes, Food for the hungry ears of little ones, And of old men who have survived their joys-- \'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works, And of the men that framed them, whether known Or sleeping nameless in their scattered graves, That I should here assert their rights, attest Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce Their benediction; speak of them as Powers For ever to be hallowed; only less, For what we are and what we may become, Than Nature\'s self, which is the breath of God, Or His pure Word by miracle revealed. Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop To transitory themes; yet I rejoice, And, by these thoughts admonished, will pour out Thanks with uplifted heart, that I was reared Safe from an evil which these days have laid Upon the children of the land, a pest That might have dried me up, body and soul. This verse is dedicate to Nature\'s self, And things that teach as Nature teaches: then, Oh! where had been the Man, the Poet where, Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend! If in the season of unperilous choice, In lieu of wandering, as we did, through vales Rich with indigenous produce, open ground Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will, We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed, Each in his several melancholy walk Stringed like a poor man\'s heifer at its feed, Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude; Or rather like a stalled ox debarred From touch of growing grass, that may not taste A flower till it have yielded up its sweets A prelibation to the mower\'s scythe. Behold the parent hen amid her brood, Though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to part And straggle from her presence, still a brood, And she herself from the maternal bond Still undischarged; yet doth she little more Than move with them in tenderness and love, A centre to the circle which they make; And now and then, alike from need of theirs And call of her own natural appetites, She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food, Which they partake at pleasure. Early died My honoured Mother, she who was the heart And hinge of all our learnings and our loves: She left us destitute, and, as we might, Trooping together. Little suits it me To break upon the sabbath of her rest With any thought that looks at others\' blame; Nor would I praise her but in perfect love. Hence am I checked: but let me boldly say, In gratitude, and for the sake of truth, Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught, Fetching her goodness rather from times past, Than shaping novelties for times to come, Had no presumption, no such jealousy, Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust Our nature, but had virtual faith that He Who fills the mother\'s breast with innocent milk, Doth also for our nobler part provide, Under His great correction and control, As innocent instincts, and as innocent food; Or draws, for minds that are left free to trust In the simplicities of opening life, Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds. This was her creed, and therefore she was pure From anxious fear of error or mishap, And evil, overweeningly so called; Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes, Nor selfish with unnecessary cares, Nor with impatience from the season asked More than its timely produce; rather loved The hours for what they are, than from regard Glanced on their promises in restless pride. Such was she--not from faculties more strong Than others have, but from the times, perhaps, And spot in which she lived, and through a grace Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness, A heart that found benignity and hope, Being itself benign. My drift I fear Is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense May try this modern system by its fruits, Leave let me take to place before her sight A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand. Full early trained to worship seemliness, This model of a child is never known To mix in quarrels; that were far beneath 0 Its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o\'er As generous as a fountain; selfishness May not come near him, nor the little throng Of flitting pleasures tempt him from his path; The wandering beggars propagate his name, Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun, And natural or supernatural fear, Unless it leap upon him in a dream, Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, see How arch his notices, how nice his sense Of the ridiculous; not blind is he To the broad follies of the licensed world, Yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd, And can read lectures upon innocence; A miracle of scientific lore, Ships he can guide across the pathless sea, And tell you all their cunning; he can read The inside of the earth, and spell the stars; He knows the policies of foreign lands; Can string you names of districts, cities, towns, The whole world over, tight as beads of dew Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs; All things are put to question; he must live Knowing that he grows wiser every day Or else not live at all, and seeing too Each little drop of wisdom as it falls Into the dimpling cistern of his heart: For this unnatural growth the trainer blame, Pity the tree.--Poor human vanity, Wert thou extinguished, little would be left Which he could truly love; but how escape? For, ever as a thought of purer birth Rises to lead him toward a better clime, Some intermeddler still is on the watch To drive him back, and pound him, like a stray, Within the pinfold of his own conceit. Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find The playthings, which her love designed for him, Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowers Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn. Oh! give us once again the wishing-cap Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood, And Sabra in the forest with St. George! The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reap One precious gain, that he forgets himself. These mighty workmen of our later age, Who, with a broad highway, have overbridged The froward chaos of futurity, Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill To manage books, and things, and make them act On infant minds as surely as the sun Deals with a flower; the keepers of our time, The guides and wardens of our faculties, Sages who in their prescience would control All accidents, and to the very road Which they have fashioned would confine us down, Like engines; when will their presumption learn, That in the unreasoning progress of the world A wiser spirit is at work for us, A better eye than theirs, most prodigal Of blessings, and most studious of our good, Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours? There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs And islands of Winander!--many a time At evening, when the earliest stars began To move along the edges of the hills, Rising or setting, would he stand alone Beneath the trees or by the glimmering lake, And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls, That they might answer him; and they would shout Across the watery vale, and shout again, Responsive to his call, with quivering peals, And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud, Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild Of jocund din; and, when a lengthened pause Of silence came and baffled his best skill, Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind, With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received Into the bosom of the steady lake. This Boy was taken from his mates, and died In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. Fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale Where he was born; the grassy churchyard hangs Upon a slope above the village school, And through that churchyard when my way has led On summer evenings, I believe that there A long half hour together I have stood Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies! Even now appears before the mind\'s clear eye That self-same village church; I see her sit (The throned Lady whom erewhile we hailed) 0 On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy Who slumbers at her feet,--forgetful, too, Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves, And listening only to the gladsome sounds That, from the rural school ascending, play Beneath her and about her. May she long Behold a race of young ones like to those With whom I herded!--(easily, indeed, We might have fed upon a fatter soil Of arts and letters--but be that forgiven)-- A race of real children; not too wise, Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh, And bandied up and down by love and hate; Not unresentful where self-justified; Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy; Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds; Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oft Bending beneath our life\'s mysterious weight Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not In happiness to the happiest upon earth. Simplicity in habit, truth in speech, Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds; May books and Nature be their early joy! And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name-- Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power! Well do I call to mind the very week When I was first intrusted to the care Of that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores, And brooks were like a dream of novelty To my half-infant thoughts; that very week, While I was roving up and down alone, Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears, Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite\'s Lake: Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloom Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore A heap of garments, as if left by one Who might have there been bathing. Long I watched, But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lake Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast, And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped The breathless stillness. The succeeding day, Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked In passive expectation from the shore, While from a boat others hung o\'er the deep, Sounding with grappling irons and long poles. At last, the dead man, \'mid that beauteous scene Of trees and hills and water, bolt upright Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear, Young as I was, a child not nine years old, Possessed me, for my inner eye had seen Such sights before, among the shining streams Of faery land, the forest of romance. Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacle With decoration of ideal grace; A dignity, a smoothness, like the works Of Grecian art, and purest poesy. A precious treasure had I long possessed, A little yellow, canvas-covered book, A slender abstract of the Arabian tales; And, from companions in a new abode, When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mine Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry-- That there were four large volumes, laden all With kindred matter, \'twas to me, in truth, A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly, With one not richer than myself, I made A covenant that each should lay aside The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more, Till our joint savings had amassed enough To make this book our own. Through several months, In spite of all temptation, we preserved Religiously that vow; but firmness failed, Nor were we ever masters of our wish. And when thereafter to my father\'s house The holidays returned me, there to find That golden store of books which I had left, What joy was mine! How often in the course Of those glad respites, though a soft west wind Ruffled the waters to the angler\'s wish, For a whole day together, have I lain Down by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream, On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun, And there have read, devouring as I read, Defrauding the day\'s glory, desperate! Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach, Such as an idler deals with in his shame, I to the sport betook myself again. A gracious spirit o\'er this earth presides, And o\'er the heart of man; invisibly It comes, to works of unreproved delight, And tendency benign, directing those Who care not, know not, think not, what they do. The tales that charm away the wakeful night In Araby, romances; legends penned For solace by dim light of monkish lamps; Fictions, for ladies of their love, devised By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun 0 By the dismantled warrior in old age, Out of the bowels of those very schemes In which his youth did first extravagate; These spread like day, and something in the shape Of these will live till man shall be no more. Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours, And \'they must\' have their food. Our childhood sits, Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne That hath more power than all the elements. I guess not what this tells of Being past, Nor what it augurs of the life to come; But so it is; and, in that dubious hour-- That twilight--when we first begin to see This dawning earth, to recognise, expect, And, in the long probation that ensues, The time of trial, ere we learn to live In reconcilement with our stinted powers; To endure this state of meagre vassalage, Unwilling to forego, confess, submit, Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamed And humbled down--oh! then we feel, we feel, We know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then, Forgers of daring tales! we bless you then, Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the ape Philosophy will call you: \'then\' we feel With what, and how great might ye are in league, Who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed, An empire, a possession,--ye whom time And seasons serve; all Faculties to whom Earth crouches, the elements are potter\'s clay, Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights, Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once. Relinquishing this lofty eminence For ground, though humbler, not the less a tract Of the same isthmus, which our spirits cross In progress from their native continent To earth and human life, the Song might dwell On that delightful time of growing youth, When craving for the marvellous gives way To strengthening love for things that we have seen; When sober truth and steady sympathies, Offered to notice by less daring pens, Take firmer hold of us, and words themselves Move us with conscious pleasure. I am sad At thought of rapture now for ever flown; Almost to tears I sometimes could be sad To think of, to read over, many a page, Poems withal of name, which at that time Did never fail to entrance me, and are now Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years Or less I might have seen, when first my mind With conscious pleasure opened to the charm Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet For their own \'sakes\', a passion, and a power; And phrases pleased me chosen for delight, For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roads Yet unfrequented, while the morning light Was yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad With a dear friend, and for the better part Of two delightful hours we strolled along By the still borders of the misty lake, Repeating favourite verses with one voice, Or conning more, as happy as the birds That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad, Lifted above the ground by airy fancies, More bright than madness or the dreams of wine; And, though full oft the objects of our love Were false, and in their splendour overwrought, Yet was there surely then no vulgar power Working within us,--nothing less, in truth, Than that most noble attribute of man, Though yet untutored and inordinate, That wish for something loftier, more adorned, Than is the common aspect, daily garb, Of human life. What wonder, then, if sounds Of exultation echoed through the groves! For, images, and sentiments, and words, And everything encountered or pursued In that delicious world of poesy, Kept holiday, a never-ending show, With music, incense, festival, and flowers! Here must we pause: this only let me add, From heart-experience, and in humblest sense Of modesty, that he, who in his youth A daily wanderer among woods and fields With living Nature hath been intimate, Not only in that raw unpractised time Is stirred to ecstasy, as others are, By glittering verse; but further, doth receive, In measure only dealt out to himself, Knowledge and increase of enduring joy From the great Nature that exists in works Of mighty Poets. Visionary power Attends the motions of the viewless winds, Embodied in the mystery of words: There, darkness makes abode, and all the host Of shadowy things work endless changes,--there, As in a mansion like their proper home, 0 Even forms and substances are circumfused By that transparent veil with light divine, And, through the turnings intricate of verse, Present themselves as objects recognised, In flashes, and with glory not their own.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSeptember 1815\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHILE not a leaf seems faded; while the fields,With ripening harvest prodigally fair,In brightest sunshine bask; this nipping air,Sent from some distant clime where Winter wieldsHis icy scimitar, a foretaste yieldsOf bitter change, and bids the flowers beware;And whispers to the silent birds, \'PrepareAgainst the threatening foe your trustiest shields.\'For me, who under kindlier laws belongTo Nature\'s tuneful quire, this rustling dry Through leaves yet green, and yon crystalline sky,Announce a season potent to renew,\'Mid frost and snow, the instinctive joys of song,And nobler cares than listless summer knew.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFrom The Italian Of Michael Angelo\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYES! hope may with my strong desire keep pace,And I be undeluded, unbetrayed;For if of our affections none finds graceIn sight of Heaven, then, wherefore hath God madeThe world which we inhabit?

Thence with speedUp the familiar hill I took my wayTowards that sweet Valley where I had been reared;\'Twas but a short hour\'s walk, ere veering round I saw the snow-white church upon her hillSit like a throned Lady, sending outA gracious look all over her domain.Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;With eager footsteps I advance and reachThe cottage threshold where my journey closed.Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,From my old Dame, so kind and motherly,While she perused me with a parent\'s pride.The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew Upon thy grave, good creature! While my heartCan beat never will I forget thy name.Heaven\'s blessing be upon thee where thou liestAfter thy innocent and busy stirIn narrow cares, thy little daily growthOf calm enjoyments, after eighty years,And more than eighty, of untroubled life;Childless, yet by the strangers to thy bloodHonoured with little less than filial love.What joy was mine to see thee once again, Thee and thy dwelling, and a crowd of things About its narrow precincts all beloved,And many of them seeming yet my own!Why should I speak of what a thousand heartsHave felt, and every man alive can guess?The rooms, the court, the garden were not leftLong unsaluted, nor the sunny seatRound the stone table under the dark pine,Friendly to studious or to festive hours;Nor that unruly child of mountain birth, The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxedWithin our garden, found himself at once,As if by trick insidious and unkind,Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down(Without an effort and without a will)A channel paved by man\'s officious care.I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,And in the press of twenty thousand thoughts,\'Ha,\' quoth I, \'pretty prisoner, are you there!\'Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered, \'An emblem here behold of thy own life;In its late course of even days with allTheir smooth enthralment;\' but the heart was full,Too full for that reproach. My aged DameWalked proudly at my side: she guided me;I willing, nay--nay, wishing to be led.--The face of every neighbour whom I metWas like a volume to me; some were hailedUpon the road, some busy at their work,Unceremonious greetings interchanged With half the length of a long field between.Among my schoolfellows I scattered roundLike recognitions, but with some constraintAttended, doubtless, with a little pride,But with more shame, for my habiliments,The transformation wrought by gay attire.Not less delighted did I take my placeAt our domestic table: and, dear Friend!In this endeavour simply to relateA Poet\'s history, may I leave untold The thankfulness with which I laid me downIn my accustomed bed, more welcome nowPerhaps than if it had been more desiredOr been more often thought of with regret;That lowly bed whence I had heard the windRoar, and the rain beat hard; where I so oftHad lain awake on summer nights to watchThe moon in splendour couched among the leavesOf a tall ash, that near our cottage stood;Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro In the dark summit of the waving treeShe rocked with every impulse of the breeze.Among the favourites whom it pleased me wellTo see again, was one by ancient rightOur inmate, a rough terrier of the hills;By birth and call of nature pre-ordainedTo hunt the badger and unearth the foxAmong the impervious crags, but having beenFrom youth our own adopted, he had passedInto a gentler service. And when first The boyish spirit flagged, and day by dayAlong my veins I kindled with the stir,The fermentation, and the vernal heatOf poesy, affecting private shadesLike a sick Lover, then this dog was usedTo watch me, an attendant and a friend,Obsequious to my steps early and late,Though often of such dilatory walkTired, and uneasy at the halts I made.A hundred times when, roving high and low, I have been harassed with the toil of verse,Much pains and little progress, and at onceSome lovely Image in the song rose upFull-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;Then have I darted forwards to let looseMy hand upon his back with stormy joy,Caressing him again and yet again.And when at evening on the public wayI sauntered, like a river murmuringAnd talking to itself when all things else Are still, the creature trotted on before;Such was his custom; but whene\'er he metA passenger approaching, he would turnTo give me timely notice, and straightway,Grateful for that admonishment, I hushedMy voice, composed my gait, and, with the airAnd mien of one whose thoughts are free, advancedTo give and take a greeting that might saveMy name from piteous rumours, such as waitOn men suspected to be crazed in brain. Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved--Regretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,But they were richly laden with all good,And cannot be remembered but with thanksAnd gratitude, and perfect joy of heart--Those walks in all their freshness now came backLike a returning Spring. When first I madeOnce more the circuit of our little lake,If ever happiness hath lodged with man,That day consummate happiness was mine, Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.The sun was set, or setting, when I leftOur cottage door, and evening soon brought onA sober hour, not winning or serene,For cold and raw the air was, and untuned:But as a face we love is sweetest thenWhen sorrow damps it, or, whatever lookIt chance to wear, is sweetest if the heartHave fulness in herself; even so with meIt fared that evening. Gently did my soul Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stoodNaked, as in the presence of her God.While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touchA heart that had not been disconsolate:Strength came where weakness was not known to be,At least not felt; and restoration cameLike an intruder knocking at the doorOf unacknowledged weariness. I tookThe balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.--Of that external scene which round me lay, Little, in this abstraction, did I see;Remembered less; but I had inward hopesAnd swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,Conversed with promises, had glimmering viewsHow life pervades the undecaying mind;How the immortal soul with God-like powerInforms, creates, and thaws the deepest sleepThat time can lay upon her; how on earth,Man, if he do but live within the lightOf high endeavours, daily spreads abroad His being armed with strength that cannot fail.Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love,Of innocence, and holiday repose;And more than pastoral quiet, \'mid the stirOf boldest projects, and a peaceful endAt last, or glorious, by endurance won.Thus musing, in a wood I sate me downAlone, continuing there to muse: the slopesAnd heights meanwhile were slowly overspreadWith darkness, and before a rippling breeze The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,Around me from among the hazel leaves,Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,The off and on companion of my walk;And such, at times, believing them to be,I turned my head to look if he were there;Then into solemn thought I passed once more. A freshness also found I at this timeIn human Life, the daily life of thoseWhose occupations really I loved;The peaceful scene oft filled me with surpriseChanged like a garden in the heat of springAfter an eight-days\' absence. For (to omitThe things which were the same and yet appearedFar otherwise) amid this rural solitude,A narrow Vale where each was known to all,\'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nookWhere an old man had used to sit alone,Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had leftIn arms, now rosy prattlers at the feetOf a pleased grandame tottering up and down;And growing girls whose beauty, filched awayWith all its pleasant promises, was goneTo deck some slighted playmate\'s homely cheek.Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,And often looking round was moved to smiles Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,Of those plain-living people now observedWith clearer knowledge; with another eyeI saw the quiet woodman in the woods,The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;Saw her go forth to church or other workOf state equipped in monumental trim;Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like), A mantle such as Spanish CavaliersWore in old times. Her smooth domestic life,Affectionate without disquietude,Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no lessHer clear though shallow stream of pietyThat ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her readHer Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,And loved the book, when she had dropped asleepAnd made of it a pillow for her head. Nor less do I remember to have felt,Distinctly manifested at this time,A human-heartedness about my loveFor objects hitherto the absolute wealthOf my own private being and no more;Which I had loved, even as a blessed spiritOr Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,Might love in individual happiness.But now there opened on me other thoughtsOf change, congratulation or regret, A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts--White Sirius glittering o\'er the southern crags,Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,Acquaintances of every little child,And Jupiter, my own beloved star!Whatever shadings of mortality,Whatever imports from the world of deathHad come among these objects heretofore, Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatteringsOf awe or tremulous dread, that had given wayIn later youth to yearnings of a loveEnthusiastic, to delight and hope.As one who hangs down-bending from the sideOf a slow-moving boat, upon the breastOf a still water, solacing himselfWith such discoveries as his eye can makeBeneath him in the bottom of the deep, Sees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers,Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,Yet often is perplexed, and cannot partThe shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depthOf the clear flood, from things which there abideIn their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleamOf his own image, by a sunbeam now,And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,Impediments that make his task more sweet; Such pleasant office have we long pursuedIncumbent o\'er the surface of past timeWith like success, nor often have appearedShapes fairer or less doubtfully discernedThan these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spiteOf pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,There was an inner falling off--I loved,Loved deeply all that had been loved before,More deeply even than ever: but a swarm Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawdsAnd feast and dance, and public revelry,And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,Than as they were a badge glossy and freshOf manliness and freedom) all conspiredTo lure my mind from firm habitual questOf feeding pleasures, to depress the zealAnd damp those yearnings which had once been mine--A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up To his own eager thoughts. It would demandSome skill, and longer time than may be sparedTo paint these vanities, and how they wroughtIn haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.It seemed the very garments that I worePreyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet streamOf self-forgetfulness.Yes, that heartless chaseOf trivial pleasures was a poor exchangeFor books and nature at that early age.\'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained Of character or life; but at that time,Of manners put to school I took small note,And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.Far better had it been to exalt the mindBy solitary study, to upholdIntense desire through meditative peace;And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,The memory of one particular hourDoth here rise up against me. \'Mid a throngOf maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid, A medley of all tempers, I had passedThe night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,With din of instruments and shuffling feet,And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,And unaimed prattle flying up and down;Spirits upon the stretch, and here and thereSlight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copseAnd open field, through which the pathway wound,And homeward led my steps. MagnificentThe morning rose, in memorable pomp,Glorious as e\'er I had beheld--in front,The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;And in the meadows and the lower groundsWas all the sweetness of a common dawn-- Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds,And labourers going forth to till the fields.Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brimMy heart was full; I made no vows, but vowsWere then made for me; bond unknown to meWas given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,A dedicated Spirit. On I walkedIn thankful blessedness, which yet survives.Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that timeA parti-coloured show of grave and gay, Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,Consorting in one mansion unreproved.The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,That summer, swarming as it did with thoughtsTransient and idle, lacked not intervalsWhen Folly from the frown of fleeting TimeShrunk, and the mind experienced in herselfConformity as just as that of old To the end and written spirit of God\'s works,Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.When from our better selves we have too longBeen parted by the hurrying world, and droop,Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;How potent a mere image of her sway;Most potent when impressed upon the mindWith an appropriate human centre--hermit, Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;Votary (in vast cathedral, where no footIs treading, where no other face is seen)Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the topOf lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;Or as the soul of that great Power is metSometimes embodied on a public road,When, for the night deserted, it assumesA character of quiet more profoundThan pathless wastes.Once, when those summer months Were flown, and autumn brought its annual showOf oars with oars contending, sails with sails,Upon Winander\'s spacious breast, it chancedThat--after I had left a flower-decked room(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survivedTo a late hour), and spirits overwroughtWere making night do penance for a daySpent in a round of strenuous idleness--My homeward course led up a long ascent,Where the road\'s watery surface, to the top Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moonAnd bore the semblance of another streamStealing with silent lapse to join the brookThat murmured in the vale. All else was still;No living thing appeared in earth or air,And, save the flowing water\'s peaceful voice,Sound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,Shown by a sudden turning of the road,So near that, slipping back into the shadeOf a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well, Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,A span above man\'s common measure, tall,Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre manWas never seen before by night or day.Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouthLooked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,A mile-stone propped him; I could also kenThat he was clothed in military garb,Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,No dog attending, by no staff sustained, He stood, and in his very dress appearedA desolation, a simplicity,To which the trappings of a gaudy worldMake a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere long,Issued low muttered sounds, as if of painOr some uneasy thought; yet still his formKept the same awful steadiness--at his feetHis shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blameNot wholly free, I watched him thus; at lengthSubduing my heart\'s specious cowardice, I left the shady nook where I had stoodAnd hailed him. Slowly from his resting-placeHe rose, and with a lean and wasted armIn measured gesture lifted to his headReturned my salutation; then resumedHis station as before; and when I askedHis history, the veteran, in reply,Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,And with a quiet uncomplaining voice,A stately air of mild indifference, He told in few plain words a soldier\'s tale--That in the Tropic Islands he had served,Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past;That on his landing he had been dismissed,And now was travelling towards his native home.This heard, I said, in pity, \'Come with me.\'He stooped, and straightway from the ground took upAn oaken staff by me yet unobserved--A staff which must have dropped from his slack handAnd lay till now neglected in the grass. Though weak his step and cautious, he appearedTo travel without pain, and I beheld,With an astonishment but ill suppressed,His ghostly figure moving at my side;Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbearTo turn from present hardships to the past,And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,On what he might himself have seen or felt.He all the while was in demeanour calm, Concise in answer; solemn and sublimeHe might have seemed, but that in all he saidThere was a strange half-absence, as of oneKnowing too well the importance of his theme,But feeling it no longer. Our discourseSoon ended, and together on we passedIn silence through a wood gloomy and still.Up-turning, then, along an open field,We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,And earnestly to charitable care Commended him as a poor friendless man,Belated and by sickness overcome.Assured that now the traveller would reposeIn comfort, I entreated that henceforthHe would not linger in the public ways,But ask for timely furtherance and helpSuch as his state required. At this reproof,With the same ghastly mildness in his look,He said, \'My trust is in the God of Heaven,And in the eye of him who passes me!\' The cottage door was speedily unbarred,And now the soldier touched his hat once moreWith his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,Whose tone bespake reviving interestsTill then unfelt, he thanked me; I returnedThe farewell blessing of the patient man,And so we parted. Back I cast a look,And lingered near the door a little space,Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHow Sweet It Is, When Mother Fancy Rocks\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHOW sweet it is, when mother Fancy rocksThe wayward brain, to saunter through a wood!An old place, full of many a lovely brood,Tall trees, green arbours, and ground-flowers in flocks;And wild rose tip-toe upon hawthorn stocks,Like a bold Girl, who plays her agile pranksAt Wakes and Fairs with wandering Mountebanks,--When she stands cresting the Clown\'s head, and mocksThe crowd beneath her. Verily I think,Such place to me is sometimes like a dream Or map of the whole world: thoughts, link by link,Enter through ears and eyesight, with such gleamOf all things, that at last in fear I shrink,And leap at once from the delicious stream.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMemorials Of A Tour In Scotland, 1803  X.

Said generous Rob, \'What need of books?Burn all the statutes and their shelves:They stir us up against our kind;And worse, against ourselves.\'We have a passion--make a law,Too false to guide us or control!And for the law itself we fightIn bitterness of soul.\'And, puzzled, blinded thus, we loseDistinctions that are plain and few: These find I graven on my heart:\'That\' tells me what to do.\'The creatures see of flood and field,And those that travel on the wind!With them no strife can last; they liveIn peace, and peace of mind.\'For why?--because the good old ruleSufficeth them, the simple plan,That they should take, who have the power,And they should keep who can. \'A lesson that is quickly learned,A signal this which all can see!Thus nothing here provokes the strongTo wanton cruelty.\'All freakishness of mind is checked;He tamed, who foolishly aspires;While to the measure of his mightEach fashions his desires.\'All kinds, and creatures, stand and fallBy strength of prowess or of wit: \'Tis God\'s appointment who must sway,And who is to submit.\'Since, then, the rule of right is plain,And longest life is but a day;To have my ends, maintain my rights,I\'ll take the shortest way.\'And thus among these rocks he lived,Through summer heat and winter snow:The Eagle, he was lord above,And Rob was lord below. So was it--\'would\', at least, have beenBut through untowardness of fate;For Polity was then too strong--He came an age too late;Or shall we say an age too soon?For, were the bold Man living \'now\',How might he flourish in his pride,With buds on every bough!Then rents and factors, rights of chase,Sheriffs, and lairds and their domains, Would all have seemed but paltry things,Not worth a moment\'s pains.Rob Roy had never lingered here,To these few meagre Vales confined;But thought how wide the world, the timesHow fairly to his mind!And to his Sword he would have said,Do Thou my sovereign will enactFrom land to land through half the earth!Judge thou of law and fact! \'\'Tis fit that we should do our part,Becoming, that mankind should learnThat we are not to be surpassedIn fatherly concern.\'Of old things all are over old,Of good things none are good enough:--We\'ll show that we can help to frameA world of other stuff.\'I, too, will have my kings that takeFrom me the sign of life and death: Kingdoms shall shift about, like clouds,Obedient to my breath.\'And, if the word had been fulfilled,As \'might\' have been, then, thought of joy!France would have had her present Boast,And we our own Rob Roy!Oh! say not so; compare them not;I would not wrong thee, Champion brave!Would wrong thee nowhere; least of allHere standing by thy grave. For Thou, although with some wild thoughts,Wild Chieftain of a savage Clan!Hadst this to boast of; thou didst loveThe \'liberty\' of man.And, had it been thy lot to liveWith us who now behold the light,Thou would\'st have nobly stirred thyself,And battled for the Right.For thou wert still the poor man\'s stay,The poor man\'s heart, the poor man\'s hand; And all the oppressed, who wanted strength,Had thine at their command.Bear witness many a pensive sighOf thoughtful Herdsman when he straysAlone upon Loch Veol\'s heights,And by Loch Lomond\'s braes!And, far and near, through vale and hill,Are faces that attest the same;The proud heart flashing through the eyes,At sound of ROB ROY\'S name.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere Is A Bondage Worse, Far Worse, To Bear\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHERE is a bondage worse, far worse, to bearThan his who breathes, by roof, and floor, and wall,Pent in, a Tyrant\'s solitary Thrall:\'Tis his who walks about in the open air,One of a Nation who, henceforth, must wearTheir fetters in their souls. For who could be,Who, even the best, in such condition, freeFrom self-reproach, reproach that he must shareWith Human-nature? Never be it oursTo see the sun how brightly it will shine, And know that noble feelings, manly powers,Instead of gathering strength, must droop and pine;And earth with all her pleasant fruits and flowersFade, and participate in man\'s decline.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEngland!

The delight,Due to this timely notice, unawaresSmote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,\'Ye heartsome Choristers, ye and I will beAssociates, and, unscared by blustering winds, Will chant together.\' Thereafter, as the shadesOf twilight deepened, going forth, I spiedA glow-worm underneath a dusky plumeOr canopy of yet unwithered fern,Clear-shining, like a hermit\'s taper seenThrough a thick forest. Silence touched me hereNo less than sound had done before; the childOf Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,Seemed sent on the same errand with the choir Of Winter that had warbled at my door,And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.The last night\'s genial feeling overflowedUpon this morning, and my favourite grove,Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft,As if to make the strong wind visible,Wakes in me agitations like its own,A spirit friendly to the Poet\'s task,Which we will now resume with lively hope,Nor checked by aught of tamer argument That lies before us, needful to be told.Returned from that excursion, soon I badeFarewell for ever to the sheltered seatsOf gowned students, quitted hall and bower,And every comfort of that privileged ground,Well pleased to pitch a vagrant tent amongThe unfenced regions of society.Yet, undetermined to what course of lifeI should adhere, and seeming to possessA little space of intermediate time At full command, to London first I turned,In no disturbance of excessive hope,By personal ambition unenslaved,Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,From dangerous passions free. Three years had flownSince I had felt in heart and soul the shockOf the huge town\'s first presence, and had pacedHer endless streets, a transient visitant:Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankindWhere Pleasure whirls about incessantly, And life and labour seem but one, I filledAn idler\'s place; an idler well contentTo have a house (what matter for a home?)That owned him; living cheerfully abroadWith unchecked fancy ever on the stir,And all my young affections out of doors.There was a time when whatsoe\'er is feignedOf airy palaces, and gardens builtBy Genii of romance; or hath in graveAuthentic history been set forth of Rome, Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis;Or given upon report by pilgrim friars,Of golden cities ten months\' journey deepAmong Tartarian wilds--fell short, far short,Of what my fond simplicity believedAnd thought of London--held me by a chainLess strong of wonder and obscure delight.Whether the bolt of childhood\'s Fancy shotFor me beyond its ordinary mark,\'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys Was One, a cripple from his birth, whom chanceSummoned from school to London; fortunateAnd envied traveller! When the Boy returned,After short absence, curiously I scannedHis mien and person, nor was free, in sooth,From disappointment, not to find some changeIn look and air, from that new region brought,As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;And every word he uttered, on my earsFell flatter than a caged parrot\'s note, That answers unexpectedly awry,And mocks the prompter\'s listening. Marvellous thingsHad vanity (quick Spirit that appearsAlmost as deeply seated and as strongIn a Child\'s heart as fear itself) conceivedFor my enjoyment. Would that I could nowRecall what then I pictured to myself,Of mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,The King, and the King\'s Palace, and, not last,Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned Lord Mayor. Dreams not unlike to those which once begatA change of purpose in young Whittington,When he, a friendless and a drooping boy,Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak outArticulate music. Above all, one thoughtBaffled my understanding: how men livedEven next-door neighbours, as we say, yet stillStrangers, not knowing each the other\'s name.Oh, wondrous power of words, by simple faithLicensed to take the meaning that we love! Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had heardOf your green groves, and wilderness of lampsDimming the stars, and fireworks magical,And gorgeous ladies, under splendid domes,Floating in dance, or warbling high in airThe songs of spirits! Nor had Fancy fedWith less delight upon that other classOf marvels, broad-day wonders permanent:The River proudly bridged; the dizzy topAnd Whispering Gallery of St. Paul\'s; the tombs Of Westminster; the Giants of Guildhall;Bedlam, and those carved maniacs at the gates,Perpetually recumbent; Statues--man,And the horse under him--in gilded pompAdorning flowery gardens, \'mid vast squares;The Monument, and that Chamber of the TowerWhere England\'s sovereigns sit in long array,Their steeds bestriding,--every mimic shapeCased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore,Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed, Or life or death upon the battle-field.Those bold imaginations in due timeHad vanished, leaving others in their stead:And now I looked upon the living scene;Familiarly perused it; oftentimes,In spite of strongest disappointment, pleasedThrough courteous self-submission, as a taxPaid to the object by prescriptive right.Rise up, thou monstrous ant-hill on the plainOf a too busy world! Before me flow, Thou endless stream of men and moving things!Thy every-day appearance, as it strikes--With wonder heightened, or sublimed by awe--On strangers, of all ages; the quick danceOf colours, lights, and forms; the deafening din;The comers and the goers face to face,Face after face; the string of dazzling wares,Shop after shop, with symbols, blazoned names,And all the tradesman\'s honours overhead:Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page, With letters huge inscribed from top to toe,Stationed above the door, like guardian saints;There, allegoric shapes, female or male,Or physiognomies of real men,Land-warriors, kings, or admirals of the sea,Boyle, Shakspeare, Newton, or the attractive headOf some quack-doctor, famous in his day.Meanwhile the roar continues, till at length,Escaped as from an enemy, we turnAbruptly into some sequestered nook, Still as a sheltered place when winds blow loud!At leisure, thence, through tracts of thin resort,And sights and sounds that come at intervals,We take our way. A raree-show is here,With children gathered round; another streetPresents a company of dancing dogs,Or dromedary, with an antic pairOf monkeys on his back; a minstrel bandOf Savoyards; or, single and alone,An English ballad-singer. Private courts, Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly lanesThrilled by some female vendor\'s scream, belikeThe very shrillest of all London cries,May then entangle our impatient steps;Conducted through those labyrinths, unawares,To privileged regions and inviolate,Where from their airy lodges studious lawyersLook out on waters, walks, and gardens green.Thence back into the throng, until we reach,Following the tide that slackens by degrees, Some half-frequented scene, where wider streetsBring straggling breezes of suburban air.Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls;Advertisements, of giant-size, from highPress forward, in all colours, on the sight;These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;\'That\', fronted with a most imposing word,Is, peradventure, one in masquerade.As on the broadening causeway we advance,Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong In lineaments, and red with over-toil.\'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,And stumping on his arms. In sailor\'s garbAnother lies at length, beside a rangeOf well-formed characters, with chalk inscribedUpon the smooth flint stones: the Nurse is here,The Bachelor, that loves to sun himself,The military Idler, and the Dame,That field-ward takes her walk with decent steps. Now homeward through the thickening hubbub, whereSee, among less distinguishable shapes,The begging scavenger, with hat in hand;The Italian, as he thrids his way with care,Steadying, far-seen, a frame of imagesUpon his head; with basket at his breastThe Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk,With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!Enough;--the mighty concourse I surveyedWith no unthinking mind, well pleased to note Among the crowd all specimens of man,Through all the colours which the sun bestows,And every character of form and face:The Swede, the Russian; from the genial south,The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remoteAmerica, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,Malays, Lascars, the Tartar, the Chinese,And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,The spectacles within doors,--birds and beasts Of every nature, and strange plants convenedFrom every clime; and, next, those sights that apeThe absolute presence of reality,Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land,And what earth is, and what she has to show.I do not here allude to subtlest craft,By means refined attaining purest ends,But imitations, fondly made in plainConfession of man\'s weakness and his loves.Whether the Painter, whose ambitious skill Submits to nothing less than taking inA whole horizon\'s circuit, do with power,Like that of angels or commissioned spirits,Fix us upon some lofty pinnacle,Or in a ship on waters, with a worldOf life, and life-like mockery beneath,Above, behind, far stretching and before;Or more mechanic artist representBy scale exact, in model, wood or clay,From blended colours also borrowing help, Some miniature of famous spots or things,--St. Peter\'s Church; or, more aspiring aim,In microscopic vision, Rome herself;Or, haply, some choice rural haunt,--the FallsOf Tivoli; and, high upon that steep,The Sibyl\'s mouldering Temple! every tree,Villa, or cottage, lurking among rocksThroughout the landscape; tuft, stone scratch minute--All that the traveller sees when he is there.Add to these exhibitions, mute and still, Others of wider scope, where living men,Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,Diversified the allurement. Need I fearTo mention by its name, as in degree,Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,Yet richly graced with honours of her own,Half-rural Sadler\'s Wells? Though at that timeIntolerant, as is the way of youthUnless itself be pleased, here more than onceTaking my seat, I saw (nor blush to add, With ample recompense) giants and dwarfs,Clowns, conjurors, posture-masters, harlequins,Amid the uproar of the rabblement,Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delightTo watch crude Nature work in untaught minds;To note the laws and progress of belief;Though obstinate on this way, yet on thatHow willingly we travel, and how far!To have, for instance, brought upon the sceneThe champion, Jack the Giant-killer: Lo! He dons his coat of darkness; on the stageWalks, and achieves his wonders, from the eyeOf living Mortal covert, \'as the moonHid in her vacant interlunar cave.\'Delusion bold! and how can it be wrought?The garb he wears is black as death, the word\'Invisible\' flames forth upon his chest.Here, too, were \'forms and pressures of the time,\'Rough, bold, as Grecian comedy displayedWhen Art was young; dramas of living men, And recent things yet warm with life; a sea-fight,Shipwreck, or some domestic incidentDivulged by Truth and magnified by Fame;Such as the daring brotherhood of lateSet forth, too serious theme for that light place--I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawnFrom our own ground,--the Maid of Buttermere,--And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wifeDeserted and deceived, the Spoiler cameAnd wooed the artless daughter of the hills, And wedded her, in cruel mockeryOf love and marriage bonds. These words to theeMust needs bring back the moment when we first,Ere the broad world rang with the maiden\'s name,Beheld her serving at the cottage inn;Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,With admiration of her modest mienAnd carriage, marked by unexampled grace.We since that time not unfamiliarlyHave seen her,--her discretion have observed, Her just opinions, delicate reserve,Her patience, and humility of mindUnspoiled by commendation and the excessOf public notice--an offensive lightTo a meek spirit suffering inwardly.From this memorial tribute to my themeI was returning, when, with sundry formsCommingled--shapes which met me in the wayThat we must tread--thy image rose again,Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace Upon the spot where she was born and reared;Without contamination doth she liveIn quietness, without anxiety:Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earthHer new-born infant, fearless as a lambThat, thither driven from some unsheltered place,Rests underneath the little rock-like pileWhen storms are raging. Happy are they both--Mother and child!--These feelings, in themselvesTrite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think On those ingenuous moments of our youthEre we have learnt by use to slight the crimesAnd sorrows of the world. Those simple daysAre now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,Which yet survive in memory, appearsOne, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,A sportive infant, who, for six months\' space,Not more, had been of age to deal aboutArticulate prattle--Child as beautifulAs ever clung around a mother\'s neck, Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.There, too, conspicuous for stature tallAnd large dark eyes, beside her infant stoodThe mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,False tints too well accorded with the glareFrom play-house lustres thrown without reserveOn every object near. The Boy had beenThe pride and pleasure of all lookers-onIn whatsoever place, but seemed in thisA sort of alien scattered from the clouds. Of lusty vigour, more than infantineHe was in limb, in cheek a summer roseJust three parts blown--a cottage-child--if e\'er,By cottage-door on breezy mountain-side,Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babeBy Nature\'s gifts so favoured. Upon a boardDecked with refreshments had this child been placed\'His\' little stage in the vast theatre,And there he sate, surrounded with a throngOf chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men And shameless women, treated and caressed;Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,While oaths and laughter and indecent speechWere rife about him as the songs of birdsContending after showers. The mother nowIs fading out of memory, but I seeThe lovely Boy as I beheld him thenAmong the wretched and the falsely gay,Like one of those who walked with hair unsingedAmid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells Muttered on black and spiteful instigationHave stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.Ah, with how different spirit might a prayerHave been preferred, that this fair creature, checkedBy special privilege of Nature\'s love,Should in his childhood be detained for ever!But with its universal freight the tideHath rolled along, and this bright innocent,Mary! may now have lived till he could lookWith envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps, Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed.Four rapid years had scarcely then been toldSince, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,I heard, and for the first time in my life,The voice of woman utter blasphemy--Saw woman as she is, to open shameAbandoned, and the pride of public vice;I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at onceThrown in that from humanity divorcedHumanity, splitting the race of man In twain, yet leaving the same outward form.Distress of mind ensued upon the sight,And ardent meditation. Later yearsBrought to such spectacle a milder sadness,Feelings of pure commiseration, griefFor the individual and the overthrowOf her soul\'s beauty; farther I was thenBut seldom led, or wished to go; in truthThe sorrow of the passion stopped me there.But let me now, less moved, in order take Our argument. Enough is said to showHow casual incidents of real life,Observed where pastime only had been sought,Outweighed, or put to flight, the set eventsAnd measured passions of the stage, albeitBy Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.Yet was the theatre my dear delight;The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,And all the mean upholstery of the place,Wanted not animation, when the tide Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fastWith the ever-shifting figures of the scene,Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dameAdvanced in radiance through a deep recessOf thick entangled forest, like the moonOpening the clouds; or sovereign king, announcedWith flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown stateOf the world\'s greatness, winding round with trainOf courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling His slender manacles; or romping girlBounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed upIn all the tatters of infirmityAll loosely put together, hobbled in,Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,From time to time, the solid boards, and makes themPrate somewhat loudly of the whereaboutOf one so overloaded with his years.But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace, The antics striving to outstrip each other,Were all received, the least of them not lost,With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,Between the show, and many-headed massOf the spectators, and each several nookFilled with its fray or brawl, how eagerlyAnd with what flashes, as it were, the mindTurned this way--that way! sportive and alertAnd watchful, as a kitten when at play,While winds are eddying round her, among straws And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!Romantic almost, looked at through a space,How small, of intervening years! For then,Though surely no mean progress had been madeIn meditations holy and sublime,Yet something of a girlish child-like glossOf novelty survived for scenes like these;Enjoyment haply handed down from timesWhen at a country-playhouse, some rude barnTricked out for that proud use, if I perchance Caught, on a summer evening through a chinkIn the old wall, an unexpected glimpseOf daylight, the bare thought of where I wasGladdened me more than if I had been ledInto a dazzling cavern of romance,Crowded with Genii busy among worksNot to be looked at by the common sun.The matter that detains us now may seem,To many, neither dignified enoughNor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them, Who, looking inward, have observed the tiesThat bind the perishable hours of lifeEach to the other, and the curious propsBy which the world of memory and thoughtExists and is sustained. More lofty themes,Such as at least do wear a prouder face,Solicit our regard; but when I thinkOf these, I feel the imaginative powerLanguish within me; even then it slept,When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart Was more than full; amid my sobs and tearsIt slept, even in the pregnant season of youth.For though I was most passionately movedAnd yielded to all changes of the sceneWith an obsequious promptness, yet the stormPassed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;Save when realities of act and mien,The incarnation of the spirits that moveIn harmony amid the Poet\'s world,Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth By power of contrast, made me recognise,As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,When, having closed the mighty Shakspeare\'s page,I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.Pass we from entertainments, that are suchProfessedly, to others titled higher,Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,More near akin to those than names imply,--I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts Before the ermined judge, or that great stageWhere senators, tongue-favoured men, perform,Admired and envied. Oh! the beating heart,When one among the prime of these rose up,--One, of whose name from childhood we had heardFamiliarly, a household term, like those,The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old,Whom the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush!This is no trifler, no short-flighted wit,No stammerer of a minute, painfully Delivered, No! the Orator hath yokedThe Hours, like young Aurora, to his car:Thrice welcome Presence! how can patience e\'erGrow weary of attending on a trackThat kindles with such glory! All are charmed,Astonished; like a hero in romance,He winds away his never-ending horn;Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense:What memory and what logic! till the strainTranscendent, superhuman as it seemed, Grows tedious even in a young man\'s ear.Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seducedBy specious wonders, and too slow to tellOf what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,And wise men, willing to grow wiser, caught,Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue--Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave.I see him,--old, but vigorous in age,--Stand like an oak whose stag-horn branches start Out of its leafy brow, the more to aweThe younger brethren of the grove. But some--While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,Against all systems built on abstract rights,Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaimsOf Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;Declares the vital power of social tiesEndeared by Custom; and with high disdain,Exploding upstart Theory, insistsUpon the allegiance to which men are born-- Some--say at once a froward multitude--Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)As the winds fret within the Aeolian cave,Galled by their monarch\'s chain. The times were bigWith ominous change, which, night by night, provokedKeen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;But memorable moments intervened,When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove\'s brain,Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one In ancient story versed, whose breast had heavedUnder the weight of classic eloquence,Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?Nor did the Pulpit\'s oratory failTo achieve its higher triumph. Not unfeltWere its admonishments, nor lightly heardThe awful truths delivered thence by tonguesEndowed with various power to search the soul;Yet ostentation, domineering, oftPoured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!-- There have I seen a comely bachelor,Fresh from a toilette of two hours, ascendHis rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,And, in a tone elaborately lowBeginning, lead his voice through many a mazeA minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,From time to time, into an orificeMost delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,And only not invisible, againOpen it out, diffusing thence a smile Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.Meanwhile the Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,Moses, and he who penned, the other day,The Death of Abel, Shakspeare, and the BardWhose genius spangled o\'er a gloomy themeWith fancies thick as his inspiring stars,And Ossian (doubt not--\'tis the naked truth)Summoned from streamy Morven--each and allWould, in their turns, lend ornaments and flowersTo entwine the crook of eloquence that helped This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the plains,To rule and guide his captivated flock.I glance but at a few conspicuous marks,Leaving a thousand others, that, in hall,Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,In public room or private, park or street,Each fondly reared on his own pedestal,Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,And all the strife of singularity, Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense--Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,There is no end. Such candidates for regard,Although well pleased to be where they were found,I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,Nor made unto myself a secret boastOf reading them with quick and curious eye;But, as a common produce, things that areTo-day, to-morrow will be, took of themSuch willing note, as, on some errand bound That asks not speed, a traveller might bestowOn sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,Or daisies swarming through the fields of June.But foolishness and madness in parade,Though most at home in this their dear domain,Are scattered everywhere, no rarities,Even to the rudest novice of the Schools.Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keepIn memory, those individual sightsOf courage, or integrity, or truth, Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,Appeared more touching. One will I select--A Father--for he bore that sacred name;--Him saw I, sitting in an open square,Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fencedA spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sateThis One Man, with a sickly babe outstretchedUpon his knee, whom he had thither broughtFor sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air. Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,He took no heed; but in his brawny arms(The Artificer was to the elbow bare,And from his work this moment had been stolen)He held the child, and, bending over it,As if he were afraid both of the sunAnd of the air, which he had come to seek,Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.As the black storm upon the mountain topSets off the sunbeam in the valley, so That huge fermenting mass of human-kindServes as a solemn back-ground, or relief,To single forms and objects, whence they draw,For feeling and contemplative regard,More than inherent liveliness and power.How oft, amid those overflowing streets,Have I gone forward with the crowd, and saidUnto myself, \'The face of every oneThat passes by me is a mystery!\'Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,Until the shapes before my eyes becameA second-sight procession, such as glidesOver still mountains, or appears in dreams;And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyondThe reach of common indication, lostAmid the moving pageant, I was smittenAbruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest Wearing a written paper, to explainHis story, whence he came, and who he was.Caught by the spectacle my mind turned roundAs with the might of waters; and apt typeThis label seemed of the utmost we can know,Both of ourselves and of the universe;And, on the shape of that unmoving man,His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,As if admonished from another world.Though reared upon the base of outward things, Structures like these the excited spirit mainlyBuilds for herself; scenes different there are,Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,Possession of the faculties,--the peaceThat comes with night; the deep solemnityOf nature\'s intermediate hours of rest,When the great tide of human life stands still:The business of the day to come, unborn,Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;The blended calmness of the heavens and earth, Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and soundsUnfrequent as in deserts; at late hoursOf winter evenings, when unwholesome rainsAre falling hard, with people yet astir,The feeble salutation from the voiceOf some unhappy woman, now and thenHeard as we pass, when no one looks about,Nothing is listened to. But these, I fear,Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,As the mind answers to them, or the heart Is prompt, or slow, to feel. What say you, then,To times, when half the city shall break outFull of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?To executions, to a street on fire,Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sightsTake one,--that ancient festival, the Fair,Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,And named of St. Bartholomew; there, seeA work completed to our hands, that lays,If any spectacle on earth can do, The whole creative powers of man asleep!--For once, the Muse\'s help will we implore,And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,Above the press and danger of the crowd,Upon some showman\'s platform. What a shockFor eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,Barbarian and infernal,--a phantasma,Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!Below, the open space, through every nookOf the wide area, twinkles, is alive With heads; the midway region, and above,Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies;With chattering monkeys dangling from their poles,And children whirling in their roundabouts;With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowdInviting; with buffoons against buffoonsGrimacing, writhing, screaming,--him who grindsThe hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves, Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum,And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks,The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,Blue-breeched, pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.--All moveables of wonder, from all parts,Are here--Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs,The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig,The Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,Giants, Ventriloquists, the Invisible Girl, The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling eyes,The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craftOf modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet-shows,All out-o\'-the-way, far-fetched, perverted things,All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughtsOf man, his dulness, madness, and their featsAll jumbled up together, to composeA Parliament of Monsters. Tents and BoothsMeanwhile, as if the whole were one vast mill,Are vomiting, receiving on all sides, Men, Women, three-years\' Children, Babes in arms.Oh, blank confusion! true epitomeOf what the mighty City is herself,To thousands upon thousands of her sons,Living amid the same perpetual whirlOf trivial objects, melted and reducedTo one identity, by differencesThat have no law, no meaning, and no end--Oppression, under which even highest mindsMust labour, whence the strongest are not free. But though the picture weary out the eye,By nature an unmanageable sight,It is not wholly so to him who looksIn steadiness, who hath among least thingsAn under-sense of greatest; sees the partsAs parts, but with a feeling of the whole.This, of all acquisitions, first awaitsOn sundry and most widely different modesOf education, nor with least delightOn that through which I passed. Attention springs, And comprehensiveness and memory flow,From early converse with the works of GodAmong all regions; chiefly where appearMost obviously simplicity and power.Think, how the everlasting streams and woods,Stretched and still stretching far and wide, exaltThe roving Indian, on his desert sands:What grandeur not unfelt, what pregnant showOf beauty, meets the sun-burnt Arab\'s eye:And, as the sea propels, from zone to zone, Its currents; magnifies its shoals of lifeBeyond all compass; spreads, and sends aloftArmies of clouds,--even so, its powers and aspectsShape for mankind, by principles as fixed,The views and aspirations of the soulTo majesty. Like virtue have the formsPerennial of the ancient hills; nor lessThe changeful language of their countenancesQuickens the slumbering mind, and aids the thoughts,However multitudinous, to move With order and relation. This, if still,As hitherto, in freedom I may speak,Not violating any just restraint,As may be hoped, of real modesty,--This did I feel, in London\'s vast domain.The Spirit of Nature was upon me there;The soul of Beauty and enduring LifeVouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused,Through meagre lines and colours, and the pressOf self-destroying, transitory things, Composure, and ennobling Harmony.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCalais, August 1802\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIS it a reed that\'s shaken by the wind,Or what is it that ye go forth to see?Lords, lawyers, statesmen, squires of low degree,Men known, and men unknown, sick, lame, and blind,Post forward all, like creatures of one kind,With first-fruit offerings crowd to bend the kneeIn France, before the new-born Majesty.\'Tis ever thus. Ye men of prostrate mind,A seemly reverence may be paid to power;But that\'s a loyal virtue, never sown In haste, nor springing with a transient shower:When truth, when sense, when liberty were flown,What hardship had it been to wait an hour?Shame on you, feeble Heads, to slavery prone!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nComposed At The Same Time And On The Same Occasion\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI DROPPED my pen; and listened to the WindThat sang of trees uptorn and vessels tost--A midnight harmony; and wholly lostTo the general sense of men by chains confinedOf business, care, or pleasure; or resignedTo timely sleep.

And full oft the Boy,Now first acquainted with distress and grief, Shrunk from his Mother\'s presence, shunned with fearHer sad approach, and stole away to find,In his known haunts of joy where\'er he might,A more congenial object. But, as timeSoftened her pangs and reconciled the childTo what he saw, he gradually returned,Like a scared Bird encouraged to renewA broken intercourse; and, while his eyesWere yet with pensive fear and gentle aweTurned upon her who bore him, she would stoop To imprint a kiss that lacked not power to spreadFaint colour over both their pallid cheeks,And stilled his tremulous lip. Thus they were calmedAnd cheered; and now together breathe fresh airIn open fields; and when the glare of dayIs gone, and twilight to the Mother\'s wishBefriends the observance, readily they joinIn walks whose boundary is the lost One\'s grave,Which he with flowers hath planted, finding thereAmusement, where the Mother does not miss Dear consolation, kneeling on the turfIn prayer, yet blending with that solemn riteOf pious faith the vanities of grief;For such, by pitying Angels and by SpiritsTransferred to regions upon which the cloudsOf our weak nature rest not, must be deemedThose willing tears, and unforbidden sighs,And all those tokens of a cherished sorrow,Which, soothed and sweetened by the grace of HeavenAs now it is, seems to her own fond heart, Immortal as the love that gave it being.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSay, What Is Honour?--\\\'ebtis The Finest Sense\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSAY, what is Honour?--\'Tis the finest senseOf \'justice\' which the human mind can frame,Intent each lurking frailty to disclaim,And guard the way of life from all offenceSuffered or done.

From his throneThe King had fallen, and that invading host--Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was writtenThe tender mercies of the dismal windThat bore it--on the plains of LibertyHad burst innocuous. Say in bolder words,They--who had come elate as eastern huntersBanded beneath the Great Mogul, when heErewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore,Rajahs and Omrahs in his train, intent To drive their prey enclosed within a ringWide as a province, but, the signal given,Before the point of the life-threatening spearNarrowing itself by moments--they, rash men,Had seen the anticipated quarry turnedInto avengers, from whose wrath they fledIn terror. Disappointment and dismayRemained for all whose fancies had run wildWith evil expectations; confidenceAnd perfect triumph for the better cause. The State--as if to stamp the final sealOn her security, and to the worldShow what she was, a high and fearless soul,Exulting in defiance, or heart-stungBy sharp resentment, or belike to tauntWith spiteful gratitude the baffled League,That had stirred up her slackening facultiesTo a new transition--when the King was crushed,Spared not the empty throne, and in proud hasteAssumed the body and venerable name Of a Republic. Lamentable crimes,\'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire workOf massacre, in which the senseless swordWas prayed to as a judge; but these were past,Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,--Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once!Things that could only show themselves and die.Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned,And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,The spacious city, and in progress passed The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay,Associate with his children and his wifeIn bondage; and the palace, lately stormedWith roar of cannon by a furious host.I crossed the square (an empty area then!)Of the Carrousel, where so late had lainThe dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazedOn this and other spots, as doth a manUpon a volume whose contents he knowsAre memorable, but from him locked up, Being written in a tongue he cannot read,So that he questions the mute leaves with pain,And half upbraids their silence. But that nightI felt most deeply in what world I was,What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.High was my room and lonely, near the roofOf a large mansion or hotel, a lodgeThat would have pleased me in more quiet times;Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.With unextinguished taper I kept watch, Reading at intervals; the fear gone byPressed on me almost like a fear to come.I thought of those September massacres,Divided from me by one little month,Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured upFrom tragic fictions or true history,Remembrances and dim admonishments.The horse is taught his manage, and no starOf wildest course but treads back his own steps;For the spent hurricane the air provides As fierce a successor; the tide retreatsBut to return out of its hiding-placeIn the great deep; all things have second birth;The earthquake is not satisfied at once;And in this way I wrought upon myself,Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,To the whole city, \'Sleep no more.\' The tranceFled with the voice to which it had given birth;But vainly comments of a calmer mindPromised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness. The place, all hushed and silent as it was,Appeared unfit for the repose of night,Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.With early morning towards the Palace-walkOf Orleans eagerly I turned: as yetThe streets were still; not so those long Arcades;There, \'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,That greeted me on entering, I could hearShrill voices from the hawkers in the throng,Bawling, \'Denunciation of the Crimes Of Maximilian Robespierre;\' the hand,Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech,The same that had been recently pronounced,When Robespierre, not ignorant for what markSome words of indirect reproof had beenIntended, rose in hardihood, and daredThe man who had an ill surmise of himTo bring his charge in openness; whereat,When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred,In silence of all present, from his seat Louvet walked single through the avenue,And took his station in the Tribune, saying,\'I, Robespierre, accuse thee!\' Well is knownThe inglorious issue of that charge, and howHe, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded,Was left without a follower to dischargeHis perilous duty, and retire lamentingThat Heaven\'s best aid is wasted upon menWho to themselves are false.But these are things Of which I speak, only as they were stormOr sunshine to my individual mind,No further. Let me then relate that now--In some sort seeing with my proper eyesThat Liberty, and Life, and Death, would soonTo the remotest corners of the landLie in the arbitrement of those who ruledThe capital City; what was struggled for,And by what combatants victory must be won;The indecision on their part whose aim Seemed best, and the straightforward path of thoseWho in attack or in defence were strongThrough their impiety--my inmost soulWas agitated; yea, I could almostHave prayed that throughout earth upon all men,By patient exercise of reason madeWorthy of liberty, all spirits filledWith zeal expanding in Truth\'s holy light,The gift of tongues might fall, and power arriveFrom the four quarters of the winds to do For France, what without help she could not do,A work of honour; think not that to thisI added, work of safety: from all doubtOr trepidation for the end of thingsFar was I, far as angels are from guilt.Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thoughtOf opposition and of remedies:An insignificant stranger and obscure,And one, moreover, little graced with powerOf eloquence even in my native speech, And all unfit for tumult or intrigue,Yet would I at this time with willing heartHave undertaken for a cause so greatService however dangerous. I revolved,How much the destiny of Man had stillHung upon single persons; that there was,Transcendent to all local patrimony,One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;That objects, even as they are great, therebyDo come within the reach of humblest eyes; That Man is only weak through his mistrustAnd want of hope where evidence divineProclaims to him that hope should be most sure;Nor did the inexperience of my youthPreclude conviction, that a spirit strongIn hope, and trained to noble aspirations,A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,Is for Society\'s unreasoning herdA domineering instinct, serves at onceFor way and guide, a fluent receptacle That gathers up each petty straggling rillAnd vein of water, glad to be rolled onIn safe obedience; that a mind, whose restIs where it ought to be, in self-restraint,In circumspection and simplicity,Falls rarely in entire discomfitureBelow its aim, or meets with, from without,A treachery that foils it or defeats;And, lastly, if the means on human will,Frail human will, dependent should betray Him who too boldly trusted them, I feltThat \'mid the loud distractions of the worldA sovereign voice subsists within the soul,Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong,Of life and death, in majesty severeEnjoining, as may best promote the aimsOf truth and justice, either sacrifice,From whatsoever region of our caresOr our infirm affections Nature pleads,Earnest and blind, against the stern decree. On the other side, I called to mind those truthsThat are the commonplaces of the schools--(A theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)Yet, with a revelation\'s liveliness,In all their comprehensive bearings knownAnd visible to philosophers of old,Men who, to business of the world untrained,Lived in the shade; and to Harmodius knownAnd his compeer Aristogiton, knownTo Brutus--that tyrannic power is weak, Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love,Nor the support of good or evil menTo trust in; that the godhead which is oursCan never utterly be charmed or stilled;That nothing hath a natural right to lastBut equity and reason; that all elseMeets foes irreconcilable, and at bestLives only by variety of disease.Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughtsStrong and perturbed, not doubting at that time But that the virtue of one paramount mindWould have abashed those impious crests--have quelledOutrage and bloody power, and--in despiteOf what the People long had been and wereThrough ignorance and false teaching, sadder proofOf immaturity, and--in the teethOf desperate opposition from without--Have cleared a passage for just government,And left a solid birthright to the State,Redeemed, according to example given By ancient lawgivers.In this frame of mind,Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,So seemed it,--now I thankfully acknowledge,Forced by the gracious providence of Heaven,--To England I returned, else (though assuredThat I both was and must be of small weight,No better than a landsman on the deckOf a ship struggling with a hideous storm)Doubtless, I should have then made common causeWith some who perished; haply perished too, A poor mistaken and bewildered offering,--Should to the breast of Nature have gone back,With all my resolutions, all my hopes,A Poet only to myself, to menUseless, and even, beloved Friend! a soulTo thee unknown!Twice had the trees let fallTheir leaves, as often Winter had put onHis hoary crown, since I had seen the surgeBeat against Albion\'s shore, since ear of mineHad caught the accents of my native speech Upon our native country\'s sacred ground.A patriot of the world, how could I glideInto communion with her sylvan shades,Erewhile my tuneful haunt? It pleased me moreTo abide in the great City, where I foundThe general air still busy with the stirOf that first memorable onset madeBy a strong levy of humanityUpon the traffickers in Negro blood;Effort which, though defeated, had recalled To notice old forgotten principles,And through the nation spread a novel heatOf virtuous feeling. For myself, I ownThat this particular strife had wanted powerTo rivet my affections; nor did nowIts unsuccessful issue much exciteMy sorrow; for I brought with me the faithThat, if France prospered, good men would not longPay fruitless worship to humanity,And this most rotten branch of human shame, Object, so seemed it, of superfluous painsWould fall together with its parent tree.What, then, were my emotions, when in armsBritain put forth her free-born strength in league,Oh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!Not in my single self alone I found,But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,Change and subversion from that hour. No shockGiven to my moral nature had I knownDown to that very moment; neither lapse Nor turn of sentiment that might be namedA revolution, save at this one time;All else was progress on the self-same pathOn which, with a diversity of pace,I had been travelling: this a stride at onceInto another region. As a lightAnd pliant harebell, swinging in the breezeOn some grey rock--its birth-place--so had IWantoned, fast rooted on the ancient towerOf my beloved country, wishing not A happier fortune than to wither there:Now was I from that pleasant station tornAnd tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,Yea, afterwards--truth most painful to record!--Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,When Englishmen by thousands were o\'erthrown,Left without glory on the field, or driven,Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,--Grief call it not, \'twas anything but that,--A conflict of sensations without name, Of which \'he\' only, who may love the sightOf a village steeple, as I do, can judge,When, in the congregation bending allTo their great Father, prayers were offered up,Or praises for our country\'s victories;And, \'mid the simple worshippers, perchanceI only, like an uninvited guestWhom no one owned, sate silent, shall I add,Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear, By violence, at one decisive rent,From the best youth in England their dear pride,Their joy, in England; this, too, at a timeIn which worst losses easily might weanThe best of names, when patriotic loveDid of itself in modesty give way,Like the Precursor when the DeityIs come Whose harbinger he was; a timeIn which apostasy from ancient faithSeemed but conversion to a higher creed; Withal a season dangerous and wild,A time when sage Experience would have snatchedFlowers out of any hedge-row to composeA chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.When the proud fleet that bears the red-cross flagIn that unworthy service was preparedTo mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,A brood of gallant creatures, on the deep;I saw them in their rest, a sojournerThrough a whole month of calm and glassy days In that delightful island which protectsTheir place of convocation--there I heard,Each evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,A monitory sound that never failed,--The sunset cannon. While the orb went downIn the tranquillity of nature, cameThat voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by meWithout a spirit overcast by darkImaginations, sense of woes to come,Sorrow for human kind, and pain of heart. In France, the men, who, for their desperate ends,Had plucked up mercy by the roots, were gladOf this new enemy. Tyrants, strong beforeIn wicked pleas, were strong as demons now;And thus, on every side beset with foes,The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of fewSpread into madness of the many; blastsFrom hell came sanctified like airs from heaven.The sternness of the just, the faith of thoseWho doubted not that Providence had times Of vengeful retribution, theirs who thronedThe human Understanding paramountAnd made of that their God, the hopes of menWho were content to barter short-lived pangsFor a paradise of ages, the blind rageOf insolent tempers, the light vanityOf intermeddlers, steady purposesOf the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,And all the accidents of life--were pressedInto one service, busy with one work. The Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,Her wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,Her frenzy only active to extolPast outrages, and shape the way for new,Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate.Domestic carnage now filled the whole yearWith feast-days; old men from the chimney-nook,The maiden from the bosom of her love,The mother from the cradle of her babe,The warrior from the field--all perished, all-- Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks,Head after head, and never heads enoughFor those that bade them fall. They found their joy,They made it proudly, eager as a child,(If like desires of innocent little onesMay with such heinous appetites be compared),Pleased in some open field to exerciseA toy that mimics with revolving wingsThe motion of a wind-mill; though the airDo of itself blow fresh, and make the vanes Spin in his eyesight, \'that\' contents him not,But with the plaything at arm\'s length, he setsHis front against the blast, and runs amain,That it may whirl the faster.Amid the depthOf those enormities, even thinking mindsForgot, at seasons, whence they had their beingForgot that such a sound was ever heardAs Liberty upon earth: yet all beneathHer innocent authority was wrought,Nor could have been, without her blessed name. The illustrious wife of Roland, in the hourOf her composure, felt that agony,And gave it vent in her last words. O Friend!It was a lamentable time for man,Whether a hope had e\'er been his or not:A woful time for them whose hopes survivedThe shock; most woful for those few who stillWere flattered, and had trust in human kind:They had the deepest feeling of the grief.Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved: The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,And throttled with an infant godhead\'s mightThe snakes about her cradle; that was well,And as it should be; yet no cure for themWhose souls were sick with pain of what would beHereafter brought in charge against mankind.Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!Were my day-thoughts,--my nights were miserable;Through months, through years, long after the last beatOf those atrocities, the hour of sleep To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,Such ghastly visions had I of despairAnd tyranny, and implements of death;And innocent victims sinking under fear,And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowdsFor sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirthAnd levity in dungeons, where the dustWas laid with tears. Then suddenly the sceneChanged, and the unbroken dream entangled me In long orations, which I strove to pleadBefore unjust tribunals,--with a voiceLabouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,Death-like, of treacherous desertion, feltIn the last place of refuge--my own soul.When I began in youth\'s delightful primeTo yield myself to Nature, when that strongAnd holy passion overcame me first,Nor day nor night, evening or morn, was freeFrom its oppression. But, O Power Supreme! Without Whose call this world would cease to breatheWho from the fountain of Thy grace dost fillThe veins that branch through every frame of life,Making man what he is, creature divine,In single or in social eminence,Above the rest raised infinite ascentsWhen reason that enables him to beIs not sequestered--what a change is here!How different ritual for this after-worship,What countenance to promote this second love! The first was service paid to things which lieGuarded within the bosom of Thy will.Therefore to serve was high beatitude;Tumult was therefore gladness, and the fearEnnobling, venerable; sleep secure,And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.But as the ancient Prophets, borne aloftIn vision, yet constrained by natural lawsWith them to take a troubled human heart,Wanted not consolations, nor a creed Of reconcilement, then when they denounced,On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyssOf their offences, punishment to come;Or saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,Before them, in some desolated place,The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;So, with devout humility be it said,So, did a portion of that spirit fallOn me uplifted from the vantage-groundOf pity and sorrow to a state of being That through the time\'s exceeding fierceness sawGlimpses of retribution, terrible,And in the order of sublime behests:But, even if that were not, amid the aweOf unintelligible chastisement,Not only acquiescences of faithSurvived, but daring sympathies with power,Motions not treacherous or profane, else whyWithin the folds of no ungentle breastTheir dread vibration to this hour prolonged? Wild blasts of music thus could find their wayInto the midst of turbulent events;So that worst tempests might be listened to.Then was the truth received into my heart,That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,If from the affliction somewhere do not growHonour which could not else have been, a faith,An elevation, and a sanctity,If new strength be not given nor old restored,The blame is ours, not Nature\'s. When a taunt Was taken up by scoffers in their pride,Saying, \'Behold the harvest that we reapFrom popular government and equality,\'I clearly saw that neither these nor aughtOf wild belief engrafted on their namesBy false philosophy had caused the woe,But a terrific reservoir of guiltAnd ignorance filled up from age to age,That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,But burst and spread in deluge through the land. And as the desert hath green spots, the seaSmall islands scattered amid stormy waves,So \'that\' disastrous period did not wantBright sprinklings of all human excellence,To which the silver wands of saints in HeavenMight point with rapturous joy. Yet not the less,For those examples, in no age surpassed,Of fortitude and energy and love,And human nature faithful to herselfUnder worst trials, was I driven to think Of the glad times when first I traversed FranceA youthful pilgrim; above all reviewedThat eventide, when under windows brightWith happy faces and with garlands hung,And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the street,Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed,I paced, a dear companion at my side,The town of Arras, whence with promise highIssued, on delegation to sustainHumanity and right, \'that\' Robespierre, He who thereafter, and in how short time!Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew.When the calamity spread far and wide--And this same city, that did then appearTo outrun the rest in exultation, groanedUnder the vengeance of her cruel son,As Lear reproached the winds--I could almostHave quarrelled with that blameless spectacleFor lingering yet an image in my mindTo mock me under such a strange reverse. O Friend! few happier moments have been mineThan that which told the downfall of this TribeSo dreaded, so abhorred. The day deservesA separate record. Over the smooth sandsOf Leven\'s ample estuary layMy journey, and beneath a genial sun,With distant prospect among gleams of skyAnd clouds and intermingling mountain tops,In one inseparable glory clad,Creatures of one ethereal substance met In consistory, like a diademOr crown of burning seraphs as they sitIn the empyrean. Underneath that pompCelestial, lay unseen the pastoral valesAmong whose happy fields I had grown upFrom childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,That neither passed away nor changed, I gazedEnrapt; but brightest things are wont to drawSad opposites out of the inner heart,As even their pensive influence drew from mine. How could it otherwise? for not in vainThat very morning had I turned asideTo seek the ground where, \'mid a throng of graves,An honoured teacher of my youth was laid,And on the stone were graven by his desireLines from the churchyard elegy of Gray.This faithful guide, speaking from his deathbed,Added no farewell to his parting counsel,But said to me, \'My head will soon lie low;\'And when I saw the turf that covered him, After the lapse of full eight years, those words,With sound of voice and countenance of the Man,Came back upon me, so that some few tearsFell from me in my own despite. But nowI thought, still traversing that widespread plain,With tender pleasure of the verses gravenUpon his tombstone, whispering to myself:He loved the Poets, and, if now alive,Would have loved me, as one not destituteOf promise, nor belying the kind hope That he had formed, when I, at his command,Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs.As I advanced, all that I saw or feltWas gentleness and peace. Upon a smallAnd rocky island near, a fragment stood,(Itself like a sea rock) the low remains(With shells encrusted, dark with briny weeds)Of a dilapidated structure, onceA Romish chapel, where the vested priestSaid matins at the hour that suited those Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.Not far from that still ruin all the plainLay spotted with a variegated crowdOf vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,Wading beneath the conduct of their guideIn loose procession through the shallow streamOf inland waters; the great sea meanwhileHeaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,Longing for skill to paint a scene so brightAnd cheerful, but the foremost of the band As he approached, no salutation givenIn the familiar language of the day,Cried, \'Robespierre is dead!\' nor was a doubt,After strict question, left within my mindThat he and his supporters all were fallen.Great was my transport, deep my gratitudeTo everlasting Justice, by this fiatMade manifest. \'Come now, ye golden times,\'Said I forth-pouring on those open sandsA hymn of triumph: \'as the morning comes From out the bosom of the night, come ye:Thus far our trust is verified; behold!They who with clumsy desperation broughtA river of Blood, and preached that nothing elseCould cleanse the Augean stable, by the mightOf their own helper have been swept away;Their madness stands declared and visible;Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earthMarch firmly towards righteousness and peace.\'--Then schemes I framed more calmly, when and how The madding factions might be tranquillised,And how through hardships manifold and longThe glorious renovation would proceed.Thus interrupted by uneasy burstsOf exultation, I pursued my wayAlong that very shore which I had skimmedIn former days, when--spurring from the ValeOf Nightshade, and St. Mary\'s mouldering fane,And the stone abbot, after circuit madeIn wantonness of heart, a joyous band Of schoolboys hastening to their distant homeAlong the margin of the moonlight sea--We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYes!

The sighs which Matthew heaved were sighsOf one tired out with fun and madness;The tears which came to Matthew\'s eyesWere tears of light, the dew of gladness.Yet, sometimes, when the secret cupOf still and serious thought went round,It seemed as if he drank it up--He felt with spirit so profound.--Thou soul of God\'s best earthly mould!Thou happy Soul! and can it be That these two words of glittering goldAre all that must remain of thee?\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWritten Upon A Blank Leaf In\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHILE flowing rivers yield a blameless sport,Shall live the name of Walton: Sage benign!Whose pen, the mysteries of the rod and lineUnfolding, did not fruitlessly exhortTo reverend watching of each still reportThat Nature utters from her rural shrine.Meek, nobly versed in simple discipline,He found the longest summer day too short,To his loved pastime given by sedgy Lee,Or down the tempting maze of Shawford brook-- Fairer than life itself, in this sweet Book,The cowslip-bank and shady willow-tree;And the fresh meads--where flowed, from every nookOf his full bosom, gladsome Piety!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIndignation Of A High-Minded Spaniard\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWE can endure that He should waste our lands,Despoil our temples, and by sword and flameReturn us to the dust from which we came;Such food a Tyrant\'s appetite demands:And we can brook the thought that by his handsSpain may be overpowered, and he possess,For his delight, a solemn wildernessWhere all the brave lie dead. But, when of bandsWhich he will break for us he dares to speak,Of benefits, and of a future day When our enlightened minds shall bless his sway;\'Then\', the strained heart of fortitude proves weak;Our groans, our blushes, our pale cheeks declareThat he has power to inflict what we lack strength to bear.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSeptember 1, 1802\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWE had a female Passenger who cameFrom Calais with us, spotless in array,--A white-robed Negro, like a lady gay,Yet downcast as a woman fearing blame;Meek, destitute, as seemed, of hope or aimShe sate, from notice turning not away,But on all proffered intercourse did layA weight of languid speech, or to the sameNo sign of answer made by word or face:Yet still her eyes retained their tropic fire, That, burning independent of the mind,Joined with the lustre of her rich attireTo mock the Outcast.--O ye Heavens, be kind!And feel, thou Earth, for this afflicted Race!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nGipsies\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYet are they here the same unbroken knotOf human Beings, in the self-same spot!Men, women, children, yea the frameOf the whole spectacle the same!Only their fire seems bolder, yielding light,Now deep and red, the colouring of night;That on their Gipsy-faces falls,Their bed of straw and blanket-walls.--Twelve hours, twelve bounteous hours are gone, while IHave been a traveller under open sky, Much witnessing of change and cheer,Yet as I left I find them here!The weary Sun betook himself to rest;--Then issued Vesper from the fulgent west,Outshining like a visible GodThe glorious path in which he trod.And now, ascending, after one dark hourAnd one night\'s diminution of her power,Behold the mighty Moon! this wayShe looks as if at them--but they Regard not her:--oh better wrong and strife(By nature transient) than this torpid life;Life which the very stars reproveAs on their silent tasks they move!Yet, witness all that stirs in heaven or earth!In scorn I speak not;--they are what their birthAnd breeding suffer them to be;Wild outcasts of society!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBook First [introduction-Childhood And School Time]\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOH there is blessing in this gentle breeze,A visitant that while it fans my cheekDoth seem half-conscious of the joy it bringsFrom the green fields, and from yon azure sky.Whate\'er its mission, the soft breeze can comeTo none more grateful than to me; escapedFrom the vast city, where I long had pinedA discontented sojourner: now free,Free as a bird to settle where I will.What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale Shall be my harbour? underneath what groveShall I take up my home? and what clear streamShall with its murmur lull me into rest?The earth is all before me. With a heartJoyous, nor scared at its own liberty,I look about; and should the chosen guideBe nothing better than a wandering cloud,I cannot miss my way. I breathe again!Trances of thought and mountings of the mindCome fast upon me: it is shaken off, That burthen of my own unnatural self,The heavy weight of many a weary dayNot mine, and such as were not made for me.Long months of peace (if such bold word accordWith any promises of human life),Long months of ease and undisturbed delightAre mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,By road or pathway, or through trackless field,Up hill or down, or shall some floating thingUpon the river point me out my course? Dear Liberty! Yet what would it availBut for a gift that consecrates the joy?For I, methought, while the sweet breath of heavenWas blowing on my body, felt withinA correspondent breeze, that gently movedWith quickening virtue, but is now becomeA tempest, a redundant energy,Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,And their congenial powers, that, while they joinIn breaking up a long-continued frost, Bring with them vernal promises, the hopeOf active days urged on by flying hours,--Days of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thoughtAbstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to makeA present joy the matter of a song,Pour forth that day my soul in measured strainsThat would not be forgotten, and are hereRecorded: to the open fields I told A prophecy: poetic numbers cameSpontaneously to clothe in priestly robeA renovated spirit singled out,Such hope was mine, for holy services.My own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind\'sInternal echo of the imperfect sound;To both I listened, drawing from them bothA cheerful confidence in things to come.Content and not unwilling now to giveA respite to this passion, I paced on With brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,To a green shady place, where down I sateBeneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choiceAnd settling into gentler happiness.\'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,With warmth, as much as needed, from a sunTwo hours declined towards the west; a dayWith silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,And in the sheltered and the sheltering groveA perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts Encouraged and dismissed, till choice was madeOf a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,Nor rest till they had reached the very doorOf the one cottage which methought I saw.No picture of mere memory ever lookedSo fair; and while upon the fancied sceneI gazed with growing love, a higher powerThan Fancy gave assurance of some workOf glory there forthwith to be begun,Perhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused, Nor e\'er lost sight of what I mused upon,Save when, amid the stately grove of oaks,Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cupDislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at onceTo the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.From that soft couch I rose not, till the sunHad almost touched the horizon; casting thenA backward glance upon the curling cloudOf city smoke, by distance ruralised;Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive, But as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,Even with the chance equipment of that hour,The road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.It was a splendid evening, and my soulOnce more made trial of her strength, nor lackedAeolian visitations; but the harpWas soon defrauded, and the banded hostOf harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,And lastly utter silence! \'Be it so;Why think of anything but present good?\' So, like a home-bound labourer, I pursuedMy way beneath the mellowing sun, that shedMild influence; nor left in me one wishAgain to bend the Sabbath of that timeTo a servile yoke. What need of many words?A pleasant loitering journey, through three daysContinued, brought me to my hermitage.I spare to tell of what ensued, the lifeIn common things--the endless store of things,Rare, or at least so seeming, every day Found all about me in one neighbourhood--The self-congratulation, and, from mornTo night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.But speedily an earnest longing roseTo brace myself to some determined aim,Reading or thinking; either to lay upNew stores, or rescue from decay the oldBy timely interference: and therewithCame hopes still higher, that with outward lifeI might endue some airy phantasies That had been floating loose about for years,And to such beings temperately deal forthThe many feelings that oppressed my heart.That hope hath been discouraged; welcome lightDawns from the east, but dawns to disappearAnd mock me with a sky that ripens notInto a steady morning: if my mind,Remembering the bold promise of the past,Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,Vain is her wish; where\'er she turns she finds Impediments from day to day renewed.And now it would content me to yield upThose lofty hopes awhile, for present giftsOf humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!The Poet, gentle creature as he is,Hath, like the Lover, his unruly times;His fits when he is neither sick nor well,Though no distress be near him but his ownUnmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleasedWhile she as duteous as the mother dove Sits brooding, lives not always to that end,But like the innocent bird, hath goadings onThat drive her as in trouble through the groves;With me is now such passion, to be blamedNo otherwise than as it lasts too long.When, as becomes a man who would prepareFor such an arduous work, I through myselfMake rigorous inquisition, the reportIs often cheering; for I neither seemTo lack that first great gift, the vital soul, Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sortOf Elements and Agents, Under-powers,Subordinate helpers of the living mind:Nor am I naked of external things,Forms, images, nor numerous other aidsOf less regard, though won perhaps with toilAnd needful to build up a Poet\'s praise.Time, place, and manners do I seek, and theseAre found in plenteous store, but nowhere suchAs may be singled out with steady choice; No little band of yet remembered namesWhom I, in perfect confidence, might hopeTo summon back from lonesome banishment,And make them dwellers in the hearts of menNow living, or to live in future years.Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistakingProud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,Will settle on some British theme, some oldRomantic tale by Milton left unsung;More often turning to some gentle place Within the groves of Chivalry, I pipeTo shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,Amid reposing knights by a river sideOr fountain, listen to the grave reportsOf dire enchantments faced and overcomeBy the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,Where spear encountered spear, and sword with swordFought, as if conscious of the blazonryThat the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;Whence inspiration for a song that winds Through ever-changing scenes of votive questWrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paidTo patient courage and unblemished truth,To firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relateHow vanquished Mithridates northward passed,And, hidden in the cloud of years, becameOdin, the Father of a race by whomPerished the Roman Empire: how the friends And followers of Sertorius, out of SpainFlying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,And left their usages, their arts and laws,To disappear by a slow gradual death,To dwindle and to perish one by one,Starved in those narrow bounds: but not the soulOf Liberty, which fifteen hundred yearsSurvived, and, when the European cameWith skill and power that might not be withstood,Did, like a pestilence, maintain its hold And wasted down by glorious death that raceOf natural heroes: or I would recordHow, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,Suffered in silence for Truth\'s sake: or tell,How that one Frenchman, through continued forceOf meditation on the inhuman deedsOf those who conquered first the Indian Isles,Went single in his ministry acrossThe Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed, But, like a thirsty wind, to roam aboutWithering the Oppressor: how Gustavus soughtHelp at his need in Dalecarlia\'s mines:How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the nameOf Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,All over his dear Country; left the deedsOf Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,To people the steep rocks and river banks,Her natural sanctuaries, with a local soulOf independence and stern liberty. Sometimes it suits me better to inventA tale from my own heart, more near akinTo my own passions and habitual thoughts;Some variegated story, in the mainLofty, but the unsubstantial structure meltsBefore the very sun that brightens it,Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,My last and favourite aspiration, mountsWith yearning toward some philosophic songOf Truth that cherishes our daily life; With meditations passionate from deepRecesses in man\'s heart, immortal verseThoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;But from this awful burthen I full soonTake refuge and beguile myself with trustThat mellower years will bring a riper mindAnd clearer insight. Thus my days are pastIn contradiction; with no skill to partVague longing, haply bred by want of power,From paramount impulse not to be withstood, A timorous capacity, from prudence,From circumspection, infinite delay.Humility and modest awe, themselvesBetray me, serving often for a cloakTo a more subtle selfishness; that nowLocks every function up in blank reserve,Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eyeThat with intrusive restlessness beats offSimplicity and self-presented truth.Ah! better far than this, to stray about Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,And ask no record of the hours, resignedTo vacant musing, unreproved neglectOf all things, and deliberate holiday.Far better never to have heard the nameOf zeal and just ambition, than to liveBaffled and plagued by a mind that every hourTurns recreant to her task; takes heart again,Then feels immediately some hollow thoughtHang like an interdict upon her hopes. This is my lot; for either still I findSome imperfection in the chosen theme,Or see of absolute accomplishmentMuch wanting, so much wanting, in myself,That I recoil and droop, and seek reposeIn listlessness from vain perplexity,Unprofitably travelling toward the grave,Like a false steward who hath much receivedAnd renders nothing back.Was it for thisThat one, the fairest of all rivers, loved To blend his murmurs with my nurse\'s song,And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,And from his fords and shallows, sent a voiceThat flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,O Derwent! winding among grassy holmsWhere I was looking on, a babe in arms,Make ceaseless music that composed my thoughtsTo more than infant softness, giving meAmid the fretful dwellings of mankindA foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm That Nature breathes among the hills and groves.When he had left the mountains and receivedOn his smooth breast the shadow of those towersThat yet survive, a shattered monumentOf feudal sway, the bright blue river passedAlong the margin of our terrace walk;A tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.Oh, many a time have I, a five years\' child,In a small mill-race severed from his stream,Made one long bathing of a summer\'s day; Basked in the sun, and plunged and basked againAlternate, all a summer\'s day, or scouredThe sandy fields, leaping through flowery grovesOf yellow ragwort; or, when rock and hill,The woods, and distant Skiddaw\'s lofty height,Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood aloneBeneath the sky, as if I had been bornOn Indian plains, and from my mother\'s hutHad run abroad in wantonness, to sportA naked savage, in the thunder shower. Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew upFostered alike by beauty and by fear:Much favoured in my birth-place, and no lessIn that beloved Vale to which erelongWe were transplanted;--there were we let looseFor sports of wider range. Ere I had toldTen birth-days, when among the mountain slopesFrost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snappedThe last autumnal crocus, \'twas my joyWith store of springes o\'er my shoulder hung To range the open heights where woodcocks runAlong the smooth green turf. Through half the night,Scudding away from snare to snare, I pliedThat anxious visitation;--moon and starsWere shining o\'er my head. I was alone,And seemed to be a trouble to the peaceThat dwelt among them. Sometimes it befellIn these night wanderings, that a strong desireO\'erpowered my better reason, and the birdWhich was the captive of another\'s toil Became my prey; and when the deed was doneI heard among the solitary hillsLow breathings coming after me, and soundsOf undistinguishable motion, stepsAlmost as silent as the turf they trod.Nor less, when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,Moved we as plunderers where the mother-birdHad in high places built her lodge; though meanOur object and inglorious, yet the endWas not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung Above the raven\'s nest, by knots of grassAnd half-inch fissures in the slippery rockBut ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)Suspended by the blast that blew amain,Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that timeWhile on the perilous ridge I hung alone,With what strange utterance did the loud dry windBlow through my ear! the sky seemed not a skyOf earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows Like harmony in music; there is a darkInscrutable workmanship that reconcilesDiscordant elements, makes them cling togetherIn one society. How strange, that allThe terrors, pains, and early miseries,Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfusedWithin my mind, should e\'er have borne a part,And that a needful part, in making upThe calm existence that is mine when IAm worthy of myself! Praise to the end! Thanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;Whether her fearless visitings, or thoseThat came with soft alarm, like hurtless lightOpening the peaceful clouds; or she would useSeverer interventions, ministryMore palpable, as best might suit her aim.One summer evening (led by her) I foundA little boat tied to a willow treeWithin a rocky cave, its usual home.Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealthAnd troubled pleasure, nor without the voiceOf mountain-echoes did my boat move on;Leaving behind her still, on either side,Small circles glittering idly in the moon,Until they melted all into one trackOf sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen pointWith an unswerving line, I fixed my viewUpon the summit of a craggy ridge, The horizon\'s utmost boundary; far aboveWas nothing but the stars and the grey sky.She was an elfin pinnace; lustilyI dipped my oars into the silent lake,And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boatWent heaving through the water like a swan;When, from behind that craggy steep till thenThe horizon\'s bound, a huge peak, black and huge,As if with voluntary power instinct,Upreared its head. I struck and struck again, And growing still in stature the grim shapeTowered up between me and the stars, and still,For so it seemed, with purpose of its ownAnd measured motion like a living thing,Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,And through the silent water stole my wayBack to the covert of the willow tree;There in her mooring-place I left my bark,--And through the meadows homeward went, in graveAnd serious mood; but after I had seen That spectacle, for many days, my brainWorked with a dim and undetermined senseOf unknown modes of being; o\'er my thoughtsThere hung a darkness, call it solitudeOr blank desertion. No familiar shapesRemained, no pleasant images of trees,Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;But huge and mighty forms, that do not liveLike living men, moved slowly through the mindBy day, and were a trouble to my dreams. Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!Thou Soul that art the eternity of thoughtThat givest to forms and images a breathAnd everlasting motion, not in vainBy day or star-light thus from my first dawnOf childhood didst thou intertwine for meThe passions that build up our human soul;Not with the mean and vulgar works of man,But with high objects, with enduring things--With life and nature--purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought,And sanctifying, by such discipline,Both pain and fear, until we recogniseA grandeur in the beatings of the heart.Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to meWith stinted kindness. In November days,When vapours rolling down the valley madeA lonely scene more lonesome, among woods,At noon and \'mid the calm of summer nights,When, by the margin of the trembling lake, Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I wentIn solitude, such intercourse was mine;Mine was it in the fields both day and night,And by the waters, all the summer long.And in the frosty season, when the sunWas set, and visible for many a mileThe cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,I heeded not their summons: happy timeIt was indeed for all of us--for meIt was a time of rapture! Clear and loud The village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,Proud and exulting like an untired horseThat cares not for his home. All shod with steel,We hissed along the polished ice in gamesConfederate, imitative of the chaseAnd woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.So through the darkness and the cold we flew,And not a voice was idle; with the dinSmitten, the precipices rang aloud; The leafless trees and every icy cragTinkled like iron; while far distant hillsInto the tumult sent an alien soundOf melancholy not unnoticed, while the starsEastward were sparkling clear, and in the westThe orange sky of evening died away.Not seldom from the uproar I retiredInto a silent bay, or sportivelyGlanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,To cut across the reflex of a star That fled, and, flying still before me, gleamedUpon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,When we had given our bodies to the wind,And all the shadowy banks on either sideCame sweeping through the darkness, spinning stillThe rapid line of motion, then at onceHave I, reclining back upon my heels,Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffsWheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolledWith visible motion her diurnal round! Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watchedTill all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.Ye Presences of Nature in the skyAnd on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!And Souls of lonely places! can I thinkA vulgar hope was yours when ye employedSuch ministry, when ye, through many a yearHaunting me thus among my boyish sports,On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, Impressed, upon all forms, the charactersOf danger or desire; and thus did makeThe surface of the universal earth,With triumph and delight, with hope and fear,Work like a sea?Not uselessly employed,Might I pursue this theme through every changeOf exercise and play, to which the yearDid summon us in his delightful round.We were a noisy crew; the sun in heavenBeheld not vales more beautiful than ours;Nor saw a band in happiness and joy Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.I could record with no reluctant voiceThe woods of autumn, and their hazel bowersWith milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,True symbol of hope\'s foolishness, whose strongAnd unreproved enchantment led us onBy rocks and pools shut out from every star,All the green summer, to forlorn cascadesAmong the windings hid of mountain brooks.--Unfading recollections! at this hour The heart is almost mine with which I felt,From some hill-top on sunny afternoons,The paper kite high among fleecy cloudsPull at her rein like an impetuous courser;Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenlyDashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.Ye lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,A ministration of your own was yours;Can I forget you, being as you were So beautiful among the pleasant fieldsIn which ye stood? or can I here forgetThe plain and seemly countenance with whichYe dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had yeDelights and exultations of your own.Eager and never weary we pursuedOur home-amusements by the warm peat-fireAt evening, when with pencil, and smooth slateIn square divisions parcelled out and allWith crosses and with cyphers scribbled o\'er, We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to headIn strife too humble to be named in verse:Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,Cherry or maple, sate in close array,And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led onA thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,Neglected and ungratefully thrown byEven for the very service they had wrought,But husbanded through many a long campaign.Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few Had changed their functions: some, plebeian cardsWhich Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,Had dignified, and called to representThe persons of departed potentates.Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!Ironic diamonds,--clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,A congregation piteously akin!Cheap matter offered they to boyish wit,Those sooty knaves, precipitated downWith scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven: The paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,Queens gleaming through their splendour\'s last decay,And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustainedBy royal visages. Meanwhile abroadIncessant rain was falling, or the frostRaged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;And, interrupting oft that eager game,From under Esthwaite\'s splitting fields of iceThe pent-up air, struggling to free itself,Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud Protracted yelling, like the noise of wolvesHowling in troops along the Bothnic Main.Nor, sedulous as I have been to traceHow Nature by extrinsic passion firstPeopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,And made me love them, may I here omitHow other pleasures have been mine, and joysOf subtler origin; how I have felt,Not seldom even in that tempestuous time,Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense Which seem, in their simplicity, to ownAn intellectual charm; that calm delightWhich, if I err not, surely must belongTo those first-born affinities that fitOur new existence to existing things,And, in our dawn of being, constituteThe bond of union between life and joy.Yes, I remember when the changeful earth,And twice five summers on my mind had stampedThe faces of the moving year, even then I held unconscious intercourse with beautyOld as creation, drinking in a pureOrganic pleasure from the silver wreathsOf curling mist, or from the level plainOf waters coloured by impending clouds.The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and baysOf Cumbria\'s rocky limits, they can tellHow, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,And to the shepherd\'s hut on distant hillsSent welcome notice of the rising moon, How I have stood, to fancies such as theseA stranger, linking with the spectacleNo conscious memory of a kindred sight,And bringing with me no peculiar senseOf quietness or peace; yet have I stood,Even while mine eye hath moved o\'er many a leagueOf shining water, gathering as it seemed,Through every hair-breadth in that field of light,New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy Which, through all seasons, on a child\'s pursuitsAre prompt attendants, \'mid that giddy blissWhich, like a tempest, works along the bloodAnd is forgotten; even then I feltGleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earthAnd common face of Nature spake to meRememberable things; sometimes, \'tis true,By chance collisions and quaint accidents(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposedOf evil-minded fairies), yet not vain Nor profitless, if haply they impressedCollateral objects and appearances,Albeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleepUntil maturer seasons called them forthTo impregnate and to elevate the mind.--And if the vulgar joy by its own weightWearied itself out of the memory,The scenes which were a witness of that joyRemained in their substantial lineamentsDepicted on the brain, and to the eye Were visible, a daily sight; and thusBy the impressive discipline of fear,By pleasure and repeated happiness,So frequently repeated, and by forceOf obscure feelings representativeOf things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,Though yet the day was distant, did becomeHabitually dear, and all their formsAnd changeful colours by invisible links Were fastened to the affections.I beganMy story early--not misled, I trust,By an infirmity of love for daysDisowned by memory--ere the breath of springPlanting my snowdrops among winter snows:Nor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so promptIn sympathy, that I have lengthened outWith fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetchInvigorating thoughts from former years; Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,And haply meet reproaches too, whose powerMay spur me on, in manhood now matureTo honourable toil. Yet should these hopesProve vain, and thus should neither I be taughtTo understand myself, nor thou to knowWith better knowledge how the heart was framedOf him thou lovest; need I dread from theeHarsh judgments, if the song be loth to quitThose recollected hours that have the charm Of visionary things, those lovely formsAnd sweet sensations that throw back our life,And almost make remotest infancyA visible scene, on which the sun is shining?One end at least hath been attained; my mindHath been revived, and if this genial moodDesert me not, forthwith shall be brought downThrough later years the story of my life.The road lies plain before me;--\'tis a themeSingle and of determined bounds; and hence I choose it rather at this time, than workOf ampler or more varied argument,Where I might be discomfited and lost:And certain hopes are with me, that to theeThis labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo The Cuckoo\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nO BLITHE New-comer! I have heard,I hear thee and rejoice.O Cuckoo! Shall I call thee Bird,Or but a wandering Voice? While I am lying on the grassThy twofold shout I hear,From hill to hill it seems to pass,At once far off, and near.Though babbling only to the Vale,Of Sunshine and of flowers,Thou bringest unto me a taleOf visionary hours.Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!Even yet thou art to meNo bird, but an invisible thing,A voice, a mystery;The same whom in my school-boy daysI listened to; that CryWhich made me look a thousand waysIn bush, and tree, and sky.To seek thee did I often roveThrough woods and on the green;And thou wert still a hope, a love;Still longed for, never seen.And I can listen to thee yet;Can lie upon the plainAnd listen, till I do begetThat golden time again.O blessed Bird! the earth we paceAgain appears to beAn unsubstantial, faery place;That is fit home for Thee!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIncident Characteristic Of A Favorite Dog\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nON his morning rounds the MasterGoes to learn how all things fare;Searches pasture after pasture,Sheep and cattle eyes with care;And, for silence or for talk,He hath comrades in his walk;Four dogs, each pair of different breed,Distinguished two for scent, and two for speed.See a hare before him started!--Off they fly in earnest chase; Every dog is eager-hearted,All the four are in the race:And the hare whom they pursue,Knows from instinct what to do;Her hope is near: no turn she makes;But, like an arrow, to the river takes.Deep the river was, and crustedThinly by a one night\'s frost;But the nimble Hare hath trustedTo the ice, and safely crost; She hath crost, and without heedAll are following at full speed,When, lo! the ice, so thinly spread,Breaks--and the greyhound, DART, is overhead!Better fate have PRINCE and SWALLOW--See them cleaving to the sport!MUSIC has no heart to follow,Little MUSIC, she stops short.She hath neither wish nor heart,Hers is now another part: A loving creature she, and brave!And fondly strives her struggling friend to save.From the brink her paws she stretches,Very hands as you would say!And afflicting moans she fetches,As he breaks the ice away.For herself she hath no fears,--Him alone she sees and hears,--Makes efforts with complainings; nor gives o\'erUntil her fellow sinks to re-appear no more.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAnd Is It Among Rude Untutored Dales\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAND is it among rude untutored Dales,There, and there only, that the heart is true?And, rising to repel or to subdue,Is it by rocks and woods that man prevails?Ah no! though Nature\'s dread protection fails,There is a bulwark in the soul. This knewIberian Burghers when the sword they drewIn Zaragoza, naked to the galesOf fiercely-breathing war. The truth was feltBy Palafox, and many a brave compeer, Like him of noble birth and noble mind;By ladies, meek-eyed women without fear;And wanderers of the street, to whom is dealtThe bread which without industry they find.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nComposed In The Valley Near Dover, On The Day Of Landing\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHERE, on our native soil, we breathe once more.The cock that crows, the smoke that curls, that soundOf bells; those boys who in yon meadow-groundIn white-sleeved shirts are playing; and the roarOf the waves breaking on the chalky shore;--All, all are English. Oft have I looked roundWith joy in Kent\'s green vales; but never foundMyself so satisfied in heart before.Europe is yet in bonds; but let that pass,Thought for another moment. Thou art free, My Country! and \'tis joy enough and prideFor one hour\'s perfect bliss, to tread the grassOf England once again, and hear and see,With such a dear Companion at my side.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFrom The Cuckoo And The Nightingale\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIThe God of Love-\'ah, benedicite!\'How mighty and how great a Lord is he!For he of low hearts can make high, of highHe can make low, and unto death bring nigh;And hard-hearts he can make them kind and free.IIWithin a little time, as hath been found,He can make sick folk whole and fresh and sound:Them who are whole in body and in mind,He can make sick,-bind can he and unbindAll that he will have bound, or have unbound.IIITo tell his might my wit may not suffice;Foolish men he can make them out of wise;-For he may do all that he will devise;Loose livers he can make abate their vice,And proud hearts can make tremble in a trice.IVIn brief, the whole of what he will, he may;Against him dare not any wight say nay;To humble or afflict whome\'er he will,To gladden or to grieve, he hath like skill;But most his might he sheds on the eve of May.VFor every true heart, gentle heart and free,That with him is, or thinketh so to be,Now against May shall have some stirring-whetherTo joy, or be it to some mourning; neverAt other time, methinks, in like degree.VIFor now when they may hear the small birds\' song,And see the budding leaves the branches throng,This unto their remembrance doth bringAll kinds of pleasure mixed with sorrowing;And longing of sweet thoughts that ever long.VIIAnd of that longing heaviness doth come,Whence oft great sickness grows of heart and home:Sick are they all for lack of their desire;And thus in May their hearts are set on fire,So that they burn forth in great martyrdom.VIIIIn sooth, I speak from feeling, what though nowOld am I, and to genial pleasure slow;Yet have I felt of sickness through the May,Both hot and cold, and heart-aches every day,-How hard, alas! to bear, I only know.IXSuch shaking doth the fever in me keepThrough all this May that I have little sleep;And also \'tis not likely unto me,That any living heart should sleepy beIn which Love\'s dart its fiery point doth steep.XBut tossing lately on a sleepless bed,I of a token thought which Lovers heed;How among them it was a common tale,That it was good to hear the Nightingale,Ere the vile Cuckoo\'s note be uttered.XIAnd then I thought anon as it was day,I gladly would go somewhere to essayIf I perchance a Nightingale might hear,For yet had I heard none, of all that year,And it was then the third night of the May.XIIAnd soon as I a glimpse of day espied,No longer would I in my bed abide,But straightway to a wood that was hard by,Forth did I go, alone and fearlessly,And held the pathway down by a brookside;XIIITill to a lawn I came all white and green,I in so fair a one had never been.The ground was green, with daisy powdered over;Tall were the flowers, the grove a lofty cover,All green and white; and nothing else was seen.XIVThere sate I down among the fair fresh flowers,And saw the birds come tripping from their bowers,Where they had rested them all night; and they,Who were so joyful at the light of day,Began to honour May with all their powers.XVWell did they know that service all by rote,And there was many and many a lovely note,Some, singing loud, as if they had complained;Some with their notes another manner feigned;And some did sing all out with the full throat.XVIThey pruned themselves, and made themselves right gay,Dancing and leaping light upon the spray;And ever two and two together were,The same as they had chosen for the year,Upon Saint Valentine\'s returning day.XVIIMeanwhile the stream, whose bank I sate upon,Was making such a noise as it ran onAccordant to the sweet Birds\' harmony;Methought that it was the best melodyWhich ever to man\'s ear a passage won.XVIIIAnd for delight, but how I never wot,I in a slumber and a swoon was caught,Not all asleep and yet not waking wholly;And as I lay, the Cuckoo, bird unholy,Broke silence, or I heard him in my thought.XIXAnd that was right upon a tree fast by,And who was then ill satisfied but I?Now, God, quoth I, that died upon the rood,From thee and thy base throat, keep all that\'s good,Full little joy have I now of thy cry.XXAnd, as I with the Cuckoo thus \'gan chide,In the next bush that was me fast beside,I heard the lusty Nightingale so sing,That her clear voice made a loud rioting,Echoing thorough all the green wood wide.XXIAh! good sweet Nightingale! for my heart\'s cheer,Hence hast thou stayed a little while too long;For we have had the sorry Cuckoo here,And she hath been before thee with her song;Evil light on her! she hath done me wrong.XXIIBut hear you now a wondrous thing, I pray;As long as in that swooning-fit I lay,Methought I wist right well what these birds meant,And had good knowing both of their intent,And of their speech, and all that they would say.XXIIIThe Nightingale thus in my hearing spake:-Good Cuckoo, seek some other bush or brake,And, prithee, let us that can sing dwell here;For every wight eschews thy song to hear,Such uncouth singing verily dost thou make.XXIVWhat! quoth she then, what is\'t that ails thee now?It seems to me I sing as well as thou;For mine\'s a song that is both true and plain,-Although I cannot quaver so in vainAs thou dost in thy throat, I wot not how.XXVAll men may understanding have of me,But, Nightingale, so may they not of thee;For thou hast many a foolish and quaint cry:-Thou say\'st OSEE, OSEE, then how may IHave knowledge, I thee pray, what this may be?XXVIAh, fool! quoth she, wist thou not what it is?Oft as I say OSEE, OSEE, I wis,Then mean I, that I should be wonderous fainThat shamefully they one and all were slain,Whoever against Love mean aught amiss.XXVIIAnd also would I that they all were dead,Who do not think in love their life to lead;For who is loth the God of Love to obey,Is only fit to die, I dare well say,And for that cause OSEE I cry; take heed!XXVIIIAy, quoth the Cuckoo, that is a quaint law,That all must love or die; but I withdraw,And take my leave of all such company,For mine intent it neither is to die,Nor ever while I live Love\'s yoke to draw.XXIXFor lovers of all folk that be alive,The most disquiet have and least do thrive;Most feeling have of sorrow woe and care,And the least welfare cometh to their share;What need is there against the truth to strive?XXXWhat! quoth she, thou art all out of thy mind,That in thy churlishness a cause canst findTo speak of Love\'s true Servants in this mood;For in this world no service is so goodTo every wight that gentle is of kind.XXXIFor thereof comes all goodness and all worth;All gentiless and honour thence come forth;Thence worship comes, content and true heart\'s pleasure,And full-assured trust, joy without measure,And jollity, fresh cheerfulness, and mirth;XXXIIAnd bounty, lowliness, and courtesy,And seemliness, and faithful company,And dread of shame that will not do amiss;For he that faithfully Love\'s servant is,Rather than be disgraced, would chuse to die.XXXIIIAnd that the very truth it is which INow say-in such belief I\'ll live and die;And Cuckoo, do thou so, by my advice.Then, quoth she, let me never hope for bliss,If with that counsel I do e\'er comply.XXXIVGood Nightingale! thou speakest wondrous fair,Yet for all that, the truth is found elsewhere;For Love in young folk is but rage, I wis:And Love in old folk a great dotage is;Who most it useth, him \'twill most impair.XXXVFor thereof come all contraries to gladness!Thence sickness comes, and overwhelming sadness,Mistrust and jealousy, despite, debate,Dishonour, shame, envy importunate,Pride, anger, mischief, poverty, and madness.XXXVILoving is aye an office of despair,And one thing is therein which is not fair;For whoso gets of love a little bliss,Unless it alway stay with him, I wisHe may full soon go with an old man\'s hair.XXXVIIAnd, therefore, Nightingale! do thou keep nigh,For trust me well, in spite of thy quaint cry,If long time from thy mate thou be, or far,Thou\'lt be as others that forsaken are;Then shalt thou raise a clamour as do I.XXXVIIIFie, quoth she, on thy name, Bird ill beseen!The God of Love afflict thee with all teen,For thou art worse than mad a thousand fold;For many a one hath virtues manifold,Who had been nought, if Love had never been.XXXIXFor evermore his servants Love amendeth,And he from every blemish them defendeth;And maketh them to burn, as in a fire,In loyalty, and worshipful desire,And, when it likes him, joy enough them sendeth.XLThou Nightingale! the Cuckoo said, be still,For Love no reason hath but his own will;-For to th\' untrue he oft gives ease and joy;True lovers doth so bitterly annoy,He lets them perish through that grievous ill.XLIWith such a master would I never be;For he, in sooth, is blind, and may not see,And knows not when he hurts and when he heals;Within this court full seldom Truth avails,So diverse in his wilfulness is he.XLIIThen of the Nightingale did I take note,How from her inmost heart a sigh she brought,And said, Alas! that ever I was born,Not one word have I now, I am so forlorn,-And with that word, she into tears burst out.XLIIIAlas, alas! my very heart will break,Quoth she, to hear this churlish bird thus speakOf Love, and of his holy services;Now, God of Love; thou help me in some wise,That vengeance on this Cuckoo I may wreak.XLIVAnd so methought I started up anon,And to the brook I ran and got a stone,Which at the Cuckoo hardily I cast,And he for dread did fly away full fast;And glad, in sooth, was I when he was gone.XLVAnd as he flew, the Cuckoo, ever and aye,Kept crying \'Farewell!-farewell, Popinjay!\'As if in scornful mockery of me;And on I hunted him from tree to tree,Till he was far, all out of sight, away.XLVIThen straightway came the Nightingale to me,And said, Forsooth, my friend, do I thank thee,That thou wert near to rescue me; and now,Unto the God of Love I make a vow,That all this May I will thy songstress be.XLVIIWell satisfied, I thanked her, and she said,By this mishap no longer be dismayed,Though thou the Cuckoo heard, ere thou heard\'st me;Yet if I live it shall amended be,When next May comes, if I am not afraid.XLVIIIAnd one thing will I counsel thee also,The Cuckoo trust not thou, nor his Love\'s saw;All that she said is an outrageous lie.Nay, nothing shall me bring thereto, quoth I,For Love, and it hath done me mighty woe.XLIXYea, hath it? use, quoth she, this medicine;This May-time, every day before thou dine,Go look on the fresh daisy; then say I,Although for pain thou may\'st be like to die,Thou wilt be eased, and less wilt droop and pine.LAnd mind always that thou be good and true,And I will sing one song, of many new,For love of thee, as loud as I may cry;And then did she begin this song full high,\'Beshrew all them that are in love untrue.\'LIAnd soon as she had sung it to the end,Now farewell, quoth she, for I hence must wend;And, God of Love, that can right well and may,Send unto thee as mickle joy this day,As ever he to Lover yet did send.LIIThus takes the Nightingale her leave of me;I pray to God with her always to be,And joy of love to send her evermore;And shield us from the Cuckoo and her lore,For there is not so false a bird as she.LIIIForth then she flew, the gentle Nightingale,To all the Birds that lodged within that dale,And gathered each and all into one place;And them besought to hear her doleful case,And thus it was that she began her tale.LIVThe Cuckoo-\'tis not well that I should hideHow she and I did each the other chide,And without ceasing, since it was daylight;And now I pray you all to do me rightOf that false Bird whom Love can not abide.LVThen spake one Bird, and full assent all gave;This matter asketh counsel good as grave,For birds we are-all here together brought;And, in good sooth, the Cuckoo here is not;And therefore we a Parliament will have.LVIAnd thereat shall the Eagle be our Lord,And other Peers whose names are on record;A summons to the Cuckoo shall be sent,And judgment there be given; or that intentFailing, we finally shall make accord.LVIIAnd all this shall be done, without a nay,The morrow after Saint Valentine\'s day,Under a maple that is well beseen,Before the chamber-window of the Queen,At Woodstock, on the meadow green and gay.LVIIIShe thanked them; and then her leave she took,And flew into a hawthorn by that brook;And there she sate and sung-upon that tree-\'For term of life Love shall have hold of me\'-So loudly, that I with that song awoke.Unlearned Book and rude, as well I know,For beauty thou hast none, nor eloquence,Who did on thee the hardiness bestowTo appear before my Lady? but a senseThou surely hast of her benevolence,Whereof her hourly bearing proof doth give;For of all good she is the best alive.Alas, poor Book! for thy unworthiness,To show to her some pleasant meanings writIn winning words, since through her gentiless,Thee she accepts as for her service fit!Oh! it repents me I have neither witNor leisure unto thee more worth to give;For of all good she is the best alive.Beseech her meekly with all lowliness,Though I be far from her I reverence,To think upon my truth and stedfastness,And to abridge my sorrow\'s violence,Caused by the wish, as knows your sapience,She of her liking proof to me would give;For of all good she is the best alive.L\'ENVOYPleasure\'s Aurora, Day of gladsomeness!Luna by night, with heavenly influenceIllumined!

II \'Dost thou presume my course to block? Off, off! or, puny Thing! I\'ll hurl thee headlong with the rock To which thy fibres cling.\' The Flood was tyrannous and strong; The patient Briar suffered long, Nor did he utter groan or sigh, Hoping the danger would be past; But, seeing no relief, at last, He ventured to reply. III \'Ah!\' said the Briar, \'blame me not; Why should we dwell in strife? We who in this sequestered spot Once lived a happy life!

Hitherto,In progress through this Verse, my mind hath lookedUpon the speaking face of earth and heavenAs her prime teacher, intercourse with manEstablished by the sovereign Intellect,Who through that bodily image hath diffused,As might appear to the eye of fleeting time,A deathless spirit. Thou also, man! hast wrought,For commerce of thy nature with herself,Things that aspire to unconquerable life; And yet we feel--we cannot choose but feel--That they must perish. Tremblings of the heartIt gives, to think that our immortal beingNo more shall need such garments; and yet man,As long as he shall be the child of earth,Might almost \'weep to have\' what he may lose,Nor be himself extinguished, but survive,Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.A thought is with me sometimes, and I say,--Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorchHer pleasant habitations, and dry upOld Ocean, in his bed left singed and bare,Yet would the living Presence still subsistVictorious, and composure would ensue,And kindlings like the morning--presage sureOf day returning and of life revived.But all the meditations of mankind,Yea, all the adamantine holds of truthBy reason built, or passion, which itself Is highest reason in a soul sublime;The consecrated works of Bard and Sage,Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,Twin labourers and heirs of the same hopes;Where would they be? Oh! why hath not the MindSome element to stamp her image onIn nature somewhat nearer to her own?Why, gifted with such powers to send abroadHer spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?One day, when from my lips a like complaint Had fallen in presence of a studious friend,He with a smile made answer, that in truth\'Twas going far to seek disquietude;But on the front of his reproof confessedThat he himself had oftentimes given wayTo kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,That once in the stillness of a summer\'s noon,While I was seated in a rocky caveBy the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,The famous history of the errant knight Recorded by Cervantes, these same thoughtsBeset me, and to height unusual rose,While listlessly I sate, and, having closedThe book, had turned my eyes toward the wide sea.On poetry and geometric truth,And their high privilege of lasting life,From all internal injury exempt,I mused; upon these chiefly: and at length,My senses yielding to the sultry air,Sleep seized me, and I passed into a dream. I saw before me stretched a boundless plainOf sandy wilderness, all black and void,And as I looked around, distress and fearCame creeping over me, when at my side,Close at my side, an uncouth shape appearedUpon a dromedary, mounted high.He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:A lance he bore, and underneath one armA stone, and in the opposite hand a shellOf a surpassing brightness. At the sight Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guideWas present, one who with unerring skillWould through the desert lead me; and while yetI looked and looked, self-questioned what this freightWhich the new-comer carried through the wasteCould mean, the Arab told me that the stone(To give it in the language of the dream)Was \'Euclid\'s Elements,\' and \'This,\' said he,\'Is something of more worth;\' and at the wordStretched forth the shell, so beautiful in shape, In colour so resplendent, with commandThat I should hold it to my ear. I did so,And heard that instant in an unknown tongue,Which yet I understood, articulate sounds,A loud prophetic blast of harmony;An Ode, in passion uttered, which foretoldDestruction to the children of the earthBy deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceasedThe song, than the Arab with calm look declaredThat all would come to pass of which the voice Had given forewarning, and that he himselfWas going then to bury those two books:The one that held acquaintance with the stars,And wedded soul to soul in purest bondOf reason, undisturbed by space or time;The other that was a god, yea many gods,Had voices more than all the winds, with powerTo exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,Through every clime, the heart of human kind.While this was uttering, strange as it may seem, I wondered not, although I plainly sawThe one to be a stone, the other a shell;Nor doubted once but that they both were books,Having a perfect faith in all that passed.Far stronger, now, grew the desire I feltTo cleave unto this man; but when I prayedTo share his enterprise, he hurried onReckless of me: I followed, not unseen,For oftentimes he cast a backward look,Grasping his twofold treasure.--Lance in rest, He rode, I keeping pace with him; and nowHe, to my fancy, had become the knightWhose tale Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,But was an Arab of the desert too;Of these was neither, and was both at once.His countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;And, looking backwards when he looked, mine eyesSaw, over half the wilderness diffused,A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:\'It is,\' said he, \'the waters of the deep Gathering upon us;\' quickening then the paceOf the unwieldy creature he bestrode,He left me: I called after him aloud;He heeded not; but, with his twofold chargeStill in his grasp, before me, full in view,Went hurrying o\'er the illimitable waste,With the fleet waters of a drowning worldIn chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,And saw the sea before me, and the book,In which I had been reading, at my side. Full often, taking from the world of sleepThis Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,This semi-Quixote, I to him have givenA substance, fancied him a living man,A gentle dweller in the desert, crazedBy love and feeling, and internal thoughtProtracted among endless solitudes;Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!Nor have I pitied him; but rather feltReverence was due to a being thus employed; And thought that, in the blind and awful lairOf such a madness, reason did lie couched.Enow there are on earth to take in chargeTheir wives, their children, and their virgin loves,Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;Enow to stir for these; yea, will I say,Contemplating in soberness the approachOf an event so dire, by signs in earthOr heaven made manifest, that I could shareThat maniac\'s fond anxiety, and go Upon like errand. Oftentimes at leastMe hath such strong entrancement overcome,When I have held a volume in my hand,Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!Great and benign, indeed, must be the powerOf living nature, which could thus so longDetain me from the best of other guidesAnd dearest helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,Even in the time of lisping infancy; And later down, in prattling childhood even,While I was travelling back among those days,How could I ever play an ingrate\'s part?Once more should I have made those bowers resound,By intermingling strains of thankfulnessWith their own thoughtless melodies; at leastIt might have well beseemed me to repeatSome simply fashioned tale, to tell again,In slender accents of sweet verse, some taleThat did bewitch me then, and soothes me now. O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,Think not that I could pass along untouchedBy these remembrances. Yet wherefore speak?Why call upon a few weak words to sayWhat is already written in the heartsOf all that breathe?--what in the path of allDrops daily from the tongue of every child,Wherever man is found? The trickling tearUpon the cheek of listening InfancyProclaims it, and the insuperable look That drinks as if it never could be full.That portion of my story I shall leaveThere registered: whatever else of powerOr pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may bePeculiar to myself, let that remainWhere still it works, though hidden from all searchAmong the depths of time. Yet is it justThat here, in memory of all books which layTheir sure foundations in the heart of man,Whether by native prose, or numerous verse, That in the name of all inspired souls--From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voiceThat roars along the bed of Jewish song,And that more varied and elaborate,Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shakeOur shores in England,--from those loftiest notesDown to the low and wren-like warblings, madeFor cottagers and spinners at the wheel,And sun-burnt travellers resting their tired limbs,Stretched under wayside hedge-rows, ballad tunes, Food for the hungry ears of little ones,And of old men who have survived their joys--\'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,And of the men that framed them, whether knownOr sleeping nameless in their scattered graves,That I should here assert their rights, attestTheir honours, and should, once for all, pronounceTheir benediction; speak of them as PowersFor ever to be hallowed; only less,For what we are and what we may become, Than Nature\'s self, which is the breath of God,Or His pure Word by miracle revealed.Rarely and with reluctance would I stoopTo transitory themes; yet I rejoice,And, by these thoughts admonished, will pour outThanks with uplifted heart, that I was rearedSafe from an evil which these days have laidUpon the children of the land, a pestThat might have dried me up, body and soul.This verse is dedicate to Nature\'s self, And things that teach as Nature teaches: then,Oh! where had been the Man, the Poet where,Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!If in the season of unperilous choice,In lieu of wandering, as we did, through valesRich with indigenous produce, open groundOf Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,We had been followed, hourly watched, and noosed,Each in his several melancholy walkStringed like a poor man\'s heifer at its feed, Led through the lanes in forlorn servitude;Or rather like a stalled ox debarredFrom touch of growing grass, that may not tasteA flower till it have yielded up its sweetsA prelibation to the mower\'s scythe.Behold the parent hen amid her brood,Though fledged and feathered, and well pleased to partAnd straggle from her presence, still a brood,And she herself from the maternal bondStill undischarged; yet doth she little more Than move with them in tenderness and love,A centre to the circle which they make;And now and then, alike from need of theirsAnd call of her own natural appetites,She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,Which they partake at pleasure. Early diedMy honoured Mother, she who was the heartAnd hinge of all our learnings and our loves:She left us destitute, and, as we might,Trooping together. Little suits it me To break upon the sabbath of her restWith any thought that looks at others\' blame;Nor would I praise her but in perfect love.Hence am I checked: but let me boldly say,In gratitude, and for the sake of truth,Unheard by her, that she, not falsely taught,Fetching her goodness rather from times past,Than shaping novelties for times to come,Had no presumption, no such jealousy,Nor did by habit of her thoughts mistrust Our nature, but had virtual faith that HeWho fills the mother\'s breast with innocent milk,Doth also for our nobler part provide,Under His great correction and control,As innocent instincts, and as innocent food;Or draws, for minds that are left free to trustIn the simplicities of opening life,Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds.This was her creed, and therefore she was pureFrom anxious fear of error or mishap, And evil, overweeningly so called;Was not puffed up by false unnatural hopes,Nor selfish with unnecessary cares,Nor with impatience from the season askedMore than its timely produce; rather lovedThe hours for what they are, than from regardGlanced on their promises in restless pride.Such was she--not from faculties more strongThan others have, but from the times, perhaps,And spot in which she lived, and through a grace Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,A heart that found benignity and hope,Being itself benign.My drift I fearIs scarcely obvious; but, that common senseMay try this modern system by its fruits,Leave let me take to place before her sightA specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand.Full early trained to worship seemliness,This model of a child is never knownTo mix in quarrels; that were far beneath Its dignity; with gifts he bubbles o\'erAs generous as a fountain; selfishnessMay not come near him, nor the little throngOf flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;The wandering beggars propagate his name,Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,And natural or supernatural fear,Unless it leap upon him in a dream,Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, seeHow arch his notices, how nice his sense Of the ridiculous; not blind is heTo the broad follies of the licensed world,Yet innocent himself withal, though shrewd,And can read lectures upon innocence;A miracle of scientific lore,Ships he can guide across the pathless sea,And tell you all their cunning; he can readThe inside of the earth, and spell the stars;He knows the policies of foreign lands;Can string you names of districts, cities, towns, The whole world over, tight as beads of dewUpon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;All things are put to question; he must liveKnowing that he grows wiser every dayOr else not live at all, and seeing tooEach little drop of wisdom as it fallsInto the dimpling cistern of his heart:For this unnatural growth the trainer blame,Pity the tree.--Poor human vanity,Wert thou extinguished, little would be left Which he could truly love; but how escape?For, ever as a thought of purer birthRises to lead him toward a better clime,Some intermeddler still is on the watchTo drive him back, and pound him, like a stray,Within the pinfold of his own conceit.Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to findThe playthings, which her love designed for him,Unthought of: in their woodland beds the flowersWeep, and the river sides are all forlorn. Oh! give us once again the wishing-capOf Fortunatus, and the invisible coatOf Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood,And Sabra in the forest with St. George!The child, whose love is here, at least, doth reapOne precious gain, that he forgets himself.These mighty workmen of our later age,Who, with a broad highway, have overbridgedThe froward chaos of futurity,Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill To manage books, and things, and make them actOn infant minds as surely as the sunDeals with a flower; the keepers of our time,The guides and wardens of our faculties,Sages who in their prescience would controlAll accidents, and to the very roadWhich they have fashioned would confine us down,Like engines; when will their presumption learn,That in the unreasoning progress of the worldA wiser spirit is at work for us, A better eye than theirs, most prodigalOf blessings, and most studious of our good,Even in what seem our most unfruitful hours?There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffsAnd islands of Winander!--many a timeAt evening, when the earliest stars beganTo move along the edges of the hills,Rising or setting, would he stand aloneBeneath the trees or by the glimmering lake,And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouthUplifted, he, as through an instrument,Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls,That they might answer him; and they would shoutAcross the watery vale, and shout again,Responsive to his call, with quivering peals,And long halloos and screams, and echoes loud,Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wildOf jocund din; and, when a lengthened pauseOf silence came and baffled his best skill, Then sometimes, in that silence while he hungListening, a gentle shock of mild surpriseHas carried far into his heart the voiceOf mountain torrents; or the visible sceneWould enter unawares into his mind,With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, receivedInto the bosom of the steady lake.This Boy was taken from his mates, and diedIn childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. Fair is the spot, most beautiful the valeWhere he was born; the grassy churchyard hangsUpon a slope above the village school,And through that churchyard when my way has ledOn summer evenings, I believe that thereA long half hour together I have stoodMute, looking at the grave in which he lies!Even now appears before the mind\'s clear eyeThat self-same village church; I see her sit(The throned Lady whom erewhile we hailed) On her green hill, forgetful of this BoyWho slumbers at her feet,--forgetful, too,Of all her silent neighbourhood of graves,And listening only to the gladsome soundsThat, from the rural school ascending, playBeneath her and about her. May she longBehold a race of young ones like to thoseWith whom I herded!--(easily, indeed,We might have fed upon a fatter soilOf arts and letters--but be that forgiven)-- A race of real children; not too wise,Too learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,And bandied up and down by love and hate;Not unresentful where self-justified;Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;Mad at their sports like withered leaves in winds;Though doing wrong and suffering, and full oftBending beneath our life\'s mysterious weightOf pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding notIn happiness to the happiest upon earth. Simplicity in habit, truth in speech,Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;May books and Nature be their early joy!And knowledge, rightly honoured with that name--Knowledge not purchased by the loss of power!Well do I call to mind the very weekWhen I was first intrusted to the careOf that sweet Valley; when its paths, its shores,And brooks were like a dream of noveltyTo my half-infant thoughts; that very week, While I was roving up and down alone,Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to crossOne of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite\'s Lake:Twilight was coming on, yet through the gloomAppeared distinctly on the opposite shoreA heap of garments, as if left by oneWho might have there been bathing. Long I watched,But no one owned them; meanwhile the calm lakeGrew dark with all the shadows on its breast, And, now and then, a fish up-leaping snappedThe breathless stillness. The succeeding day,Those unclaimed garments telling a plain taleDrew to the spot an anxious crowd; some lookedIn passive expectation from the shore,While from a boat others hung o\'er the deep,Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.At last, the dead man, \'mid that beauteous sceneOf trees and hills and water, bolt uprightRose, with his ghastly face, a spectre shape Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,Young as I was, a child not nine years old,Possessed me, for my inner eye had seenSuch sights before, among the shining streamsOf faery land, the forest of romance.Their spirit hallowed the sad spectacleWith decoration of ideal grace;A dignity, a smoothness, like the worksOf Grecian art, and purest poesy.A precious treasure had I long possessed, A little yellow, canvas-covered book,A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;And, from companions in a new abode,When first I learnt, that this dear prize of mineWas but a block hewn from a mighty quarry--That there were four large volumes, laden allWith kindred matter, \'twas to me, in truth,A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,With one not richer than myself, I madeA covenant that each should lay aside The moneys he possessed, and hoard up more,Till our joint savings had amassed enoughTo make this book our own. Through several months,In spite of all temptation, we preservedReligiously that vow; but firmness failed,Nor were we ever masters of our wish.And when thereafter to my father\'s houseThe holidays returned me, there to findThat golden store of books which I had left,What joy was mine! How often in the course Of those glad respites, though a soft west windRuffled the waters to the angler\'s wish,For a whole day together, have I lainDown by thy side, O Derwent! murmuring stream,On the hot stones, and in the glaring sun,And there have read, devouring as I read,Defrauding the day\'s glory, desperate!Till with a sudden bound of smart reproach,Such as an idler deals with in his shame,I to the sport betook myself again. A gracious spirit o\'er this earth presides,And o\'er the heart of man; invisiblyIt comes, to works of unreproved delight,And tendency benign, directing thoseWho care not, know not, think not, what they do.The tales that charm away the wakeful nightIn Araby, romances; legends pennedFor solace by dim light of monkish lamps;Fictions, for ladies of their love, devisedBy youthful squires; adventures endless, spun By the dismantled warrior in old age,Out of the bowels of those very schemesIn which his youth did first extravagate;These spread like day, and something in the shapeOf these will live till man shall be no more.Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours,And \'they must\' have their food. Our childhood sits,Our simple childhood, sits upon a throneThat hath more power than all the elements.I guess not what this tells of Being past, Nor what it augurs of the life to come;But so it is; and, in that dubious hour--That twilight--when we first begin to seeThis dawning earth, to recognise, expect,And, in the long probation that ensues,The time of trial, ere we learn to liveIn reconcilement with our stinted powers;To endure this state of meagre vassalage,Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows To custom, mettlesome, and not yet tamedAnd humbled down--oh! then we feel, we feel,We know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,Forgers of daring tales! we bless you then,Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the apePhilosophy will call you: \'then\' we feelWith what, and how great might ye are in league,Who make our wish, our power, our thought a deed,An empire, a possession,--ye whom timeAnd seasons serve; all Faculties to whom Earth crouches, the elements are potter\'s clay,Space like a heaven filled up with northern lights,Here, nowhere, there, and everywhere at once.Relinquishing this lofty eminenceFor ground, though humbler, not the less a tractOf the same isthmus, which our spirits crossIn progress from their native continentTo earth and human life, the Song might dwellOn that delightful time of growing youth,When craving for the marvellous gives way To strengthening love for things that we have seen;When sober truth and steady sympathies,Offered to notice by less daring pens,Take firmer hold of us, and words themselvesMove us with conscious pleasure.I am sadAt thought of rapture now for ever flown;Almost to tears I sometimes could be sadTo think of, to read over, many a page,Poems withal of name, which at that timeDid never fail to entrance me, and are now Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatreFresh emptied of spectators. Twice five yearsOr less I might have seen, when first my mindWith conscious pleasure opened to the charmOf words in tuneful order, found them sweetFor their own \'sakes\', a passion, and a power;And phrases pleased me chosen for delight,For pomp, or love. Oft, in the public roadsYet unfrequented, while the morning lightWas yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad With a dear friend, and for the better partOf two delightful hours we strolled alongBy the still borders of the misty lake,Repeating favourite verses with one voice,Or conning more, as happy as the birdsThat round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,Lifted above the ground by airy fancies,More bright than madness or the dreams of wine;And, though full oft the objects of our loveWere false, and in their splendour overwrought, Yet was there surely then no vulgar powerWorking within us,--nothing less, in truth,Than that most noble attribute of man,Though yet untutored and inordinate,That wish for something loftier, more adorned,Than is the common aspect, daily garb,Of human life. What wonder, then, if soundsOf exultation echoed through the groves!For, images, and sentiments, and words,And everything encountered or pursued In that delicious world of poesy,Kept holiday, a never-ending show,With music, incense, festival, and flowers!Here must we pause: this only let me add,From heart-experience, and in humblest senseOf modesty, that he, who in his youthA daily wanderer among woods and fieldsWith living Nature hath been intimate,Not only in that raw unpractised timeIs stirred to ecstasy, as others are, By glittering verse; but further, doth receive,In measure only dealt out to himself,Knowledge and increase of enduring joyFrom the great Nature that exists in worksOf mighty Poets. Visionary powerAttends the motions of the viewless winds,Embodied in the mystery of words:There, darkness makes abode, and all the hostOf shadowy things work endless changes,--there,As in a mansion like their proper home, Even forms and substances are circumfusedBy that transparent veil with light divine,And, through the turnings intricate of verse,Present themselves as objects recognised,In flashes, and with glory not their own.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYes, It Was The Mountain Echo\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYES, it was the mountain Echo,Solitary, clear, profound,Answering to the shouting Cuckoo,Giving to her sound for sound!Unsolicited replyTo a babbling wanderer sent;Like her ordinary cry,Like--but oh, how different!Hears not also mortal Life?Hear not we, unthinking Creatures!

So speaks the Chronicle, and tells of LearBy his ungrateful daughters turned adrift.Ye lightnings, hear his voice!-they cannot hear,Nor can the winds restore his simple gift.But One there is, a Child of nature meek,Who comes her Sire to seek;And he, recovering sense, upon her breastLeans smilingly, and sinks into a perfect rest.There too we read of Spenser\'s fairy themes,And those that Milton loved in youthful years; The sage enchanter Merlin\'s subtle schemes;The feats of Arthur and his knightly peers;Of Arthur,-who, to upper light restored,With that terrific swordWhich yet he brandishes for future war,Shall lift his country\'s fame above the polar star!What wonder, then, if in such ample fieldOf old tradition, one particular flowerDoth seemingly in vain its fragrance yield,And bloom unnoticed even to this late hour? Now, gentle Muses, your assistance grant,While I this flower transplantInto a garden stored with Poesy;Where flowers and herbs unite, and haply some weeds be,That, wanting not wild grace, are from all mischief free!A KING more worthy of respect and loveThan wise Gorbonian ruled not in his day;And grateful Britain prospered far aboveAll neighbouring countries through his righteous sway;He poured rewards and honours on the good; The oppressor he withstood;And while he served the Gods with reverence dueFields smiled, and temples rose, and towns and cities grew.He died, whom Artegal succeeds-his son;But how unworthy of that sire was he!A hopeful reign, auspiciously begun,Was darkened soon by foul iniquity.From crime to crime he mounted, till at lengthThe nobles leagued their strengthWith a vexed people, and the tyrant chased; And, on the vacant throne, his worthier Brother placed.From realm to realm the humbled Exile went,Suppliant for aid his kingdom to regain;In many a court, and many a warrior\'s tent,He urged his persevering suit in vain.Him, in whose wretched heart ambition failed,Dire poverty assailed;And, tired with slights his pride no more could brook,He towards his native country cast a longing look.Fair blew the wished-for wind-the voyage sped; He landed; and, by many dangers scared,\'Poorly provided, poorly followed,\'To Calaterium\'s forest he repaired.How changed from him who, born to highest place,Had swayed the royal mace,Flattered and feared, despised yet deified,In Troynovant, his seat by silver Thames\'s side!From that wild region where the crownless KingLay in concealment with his scanty train,Supporting life by water from the spring, And such chance food as outlaws can obtain,Unto the few whom he esteems his friendsA messenger he sends;And from their secret loyalty requiresShelter and daily bread,-the sum of his desires.While he the issue waits, at early mornWandering by stealth abroad, he chanced to hearA startling outcry made by hound and horn,From which the tusky wild boar flies in fear;And, scouring toward him o\'er the grassy plain, Behold the hunter train!He bids his little company advanceWith seeming unconcern and steady countenance.The royal Elidure, who leads the chase,Hath checked his foaming courser:-can it be!Methinks that I should recognise that face,Though much disguised by long adversity!He gazed rejoicing, and again he gazed,Confounded and amazed-\'It is the king, my brother!\' and, by sound Of his own voice confirmed, he leaps upon the ground.Long, strict, and tender was the embrace he gave,Feebly returned by daunted Artegal;Whose natural affection doubts enslave,And apprehensions dark and criminal.Loth to restrain the moving interview,The attendant lords withdrew;And, while they stood upon the plain apart,Thus Elidure, by words, relieved his struggling heart.\'By heavenly Powers conducted, we have met; -O Brother! to my knowledge lost so long,But neither lost to love, nor to regret,Nor to my wishes lost;-forgive the wrong,(Such it may seem) if I thy crown have borne,Thy royal mantle worn:I was their natural guardian; and \'tis justThat now I should restore what hath been held in trust.\'A while the astonished Artegal stood mute,Then thus exclaimed: \'To me, of titles shorn,And stripped of power! me, feeble, destitute, To me a kingdom! spare the bitter scorn:If justice ruled the breast of foreign kings,Then, on the wide-spread wingsOf war, had I returned to claim my right;This will I here avow, not dreading thy despite.\'\'I do not blame thee,\' Elidure replied;\'But, if my looks did with my words agree,I should at once be trusted, not defied,And thou from all disquietude be free.May the unsullied Goddess of the chase, Who to this blessed placeAt this blest moment led me, if I speakWith insincere intent, on me her vengeance wreak!\'Were this same spear, which in my hand I grasp.The British sceptre, here would I to theeThe symbol yield; and would undo this clasp,If it confined the robe of sovereignty.Odious to me the pomp of regal court,And joyless sylvan sport,While thou art roving, wretched and forlorn, Thy couch the dewy earth, thy roof the forest thorn!\'Then Artegal thus spake: \'I only sought,Within this realm a place of safe retreat;Beware of rousing an ambitious thought;Beware of kindling hopes, for me unmeet!Thou art reputed wise, but in my mindArt pitiably blind:Full soon this generous purpose thou may\'st rue,When that which has been done no wishes can undo.\'Who, when a crown is fixed upon his head, Would balance claim with claim, and right with right?But thou-I know not how inspired, how led-Wouldst change the course of things in all men\'s sight!And this for one who cannot imitateThy virtue, who may hate:For, if, by such strange sacrifice restored,He reign, thou still must be his king, and sovereign lord;\'Lifted in magnanimity aboveAught that my feeble nature could perform,Or even conceive; surpassing me in love Far as in power the eagle doth the worm.I, Brother!

And there is one whom I five years have known; He dwells alone Upon Helvellyn\'s side: He loved--the pretty Barbara died; And thus he makes his moan: Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid When thus his moan he made: "Oh, move, thou Cottage, from behind that oak! Or let the aged tree uprooted lie, That in some other way yon smoke May mount into the sky! The clouds pass on; they from the heavens depart. I look--the sky is empty space; I know not what I trace; But when I cease to look, my hand is on my heart. "Oh! what a weight is in these shades! Ye leaves, That murmur once so dear, when will it cease? Your sound my heart of rest bereaves, It robs my heart of peace. Thou Thrush, that singest loud--and loud and free, Into yon row of willows flit, Upon that alder sit; Or sing another song, or choose another tree. "Roll back, sweet Rill! back to thy mountain-bounds, And there for ever be thy waters chained! For thou dost haunt the air with sounds That cannot be sustained; If still beneath that pine-tree\'s ragged bough Headlong yon waterfall must come, Oh let it then be dumb! Be anything, sweet Rill, but that which thou art now. "Thou Eglantine, so bright with sunny showers, Proud as a rainbow spanning half the vale, Thou one fair shrub, oh! shed thy flowers, And stir not in the gale. For thus to see thee nodding in the air, To see thy arch thus stretch and bend, Thus rise and thus descend,-- Disturbs me till the sight is more than I can dear." The Man who makes this feverish complaint Is one of giant stature, who could dance Equipped from head to foot in iron mail. Ah gentle Love! if ever thought was thine To store up kindred hours for me, thy face Turn from me, gentle Love! nor let me walk Within the sound of Emma\'s voice, nor know Such happiness as I have known to-day.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Two April Mornings\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWe walked along, while bright and red Uprose the morning sun; And Matthew stopped, he looked, and said, \'The will of God be done!\' A village schoolmaster was he, With hair of glittering grey; As blithe a man as yon could see On a spring holiday. And on that morning, through the grass, And by the steaming rills, We travelled merrily, to pass A day among the hills. \'Our work,\' said I, \'was well begun, Then, from thy breast what thought, Beneath so beautiful a sun, So sad a sigh has brought?\' A second time did Matthew stop; And fixing still his eye Upon the eastern mountain-top, To me he made reply: \'Yon cloud with that long purple cleft Brings fresh into my mind A day like this which I have left Full thirty years behind. \'And just above yon slope of corn Such colours, and no other, Were in the sky, that April morn, Of this the very brother. \'With rod and line I sued the sport Which that sweet season gave, And, to the church-yard come, stopped short Beside my daughter\'s grave. \'Nine summers had she scarcely seen, The pride of all the vale; And then she sang;--she would have been A very nightingale. \'Six feet in earth my Emma lay; And yet I loved her more, For so it seemed, than till that day I e\'er had loved before. \'And, turning from her grave, I met, Beside the church-yard yew, A blooming Girl, whose hair was wet With points of morning dew. \'A basket on her head she bare; Her brow was smooth and white: To see a child so very fair, It was a pure delight! \'No fountain from its rocky cave E\'er tripped with foot so free; She seemed as happy as a wave That dances on the sea. \'There came from me a sigh of pain Which I could ill confine; I looked at her, and looked again: And did not wish her mine!\' Matthew is in his grave, yet now, Methinks, I see him stand, As at that moment, with a bough Of wilding in his hand.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo A Sexton\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLet thy wheel-barrow alone-- Wherefore, Sexton, piling still In thy bone-house bone on bone? \'Tis already like a hill In a field of battle made, Where three thousand skulls are laid; These died in peace each with the other,-- Father, sister, friend, and brother. Mark the spot to which I point! From this platform, eight feet square, Take not even a finger-joint: Andrew\'s whole fire-side is there. Here, alone, before thine eyes, Simon\'s sickly daughter lies, From weakness now, and pain defended, Whom he twenty winters tended. Look but at the gardener\'s pride-- How he glories, when he sees Roses, lilies, side by side, Violets in families! By the heart of Man, his tears, By his hopes and by his fears, Thou, too heedless, art the Warden Of a far superior garden. Thus then, each to other dear, Let them all in quiet lie, Andrew there, and Susan here, Neighbours in mortality. And, should I live through sun and rain Seven widowed years without my Jane, O Sexton, do not then remove her, Let one grave hold the Loved and Lover!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo A Highland Girl (At Inversneyde, Upon Loch Lomond)\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower   Of beauty is thy earthly dower!   Twice seven consenting years have shed   Their utmost bounty on thy head:   And these grey rocks; that household lawn;   Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;   This fall of water that doth make   A murmur near the silent lake;   This little bay; a quiet road  That holds in shelter thy Abode--  In truth together do ye seem  Like something fashioned in a dream;  Such Forms as from their covert peep  When earthly cares are laid asleep!  But, O fair Creature! in the light  Of common day, so heavenly bright,  I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,  I bless thee with a human heart;  God shield thee to thy latest years!  Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;  And yet my eyes are filled with tears.     With earnest feeling I shall pray  For thee when I am far away:  For never saw I mien, or face,  In which more plainly I could trace  Benignity and home-bred sense  Ripening in perfect innocence.  Here scattered, like a random seed,  Remote from men, Thou dost not need  The embarrassed look of shy distress,  And maidenly shamefacedness:  Thou wear\'st upon thy forehead clear  The freedom of a Mountaineer:  A face with gladness overspread!  Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!  And seemliness complete, that sways  Thy courtesies, about thee plays;  With no restraint, but such as springs  From quick and eager visitings  Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach  Of thy few words of English speech:  A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife  That gives thy gestures grace and life!  So have I, not unmoved in mind,  Seen birds of tempest-loving kind--  Thus beating up against the wind.     What hand but would a garland cull  For thee who art so beautiful?  O happy pleasure! here to dwell  Beside thee in some heathy dell;  Adopt your homely ways, and dress,  A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!  But I could frame a wish for thee  More like a grave reality:  Thou art to me but as a wave  Of the wild sea; and I would have  Some claim upon thee, if I could,  Though but of common neighbourhood.  What joy to hear thee, and to see!  Thy elder Brother I would be,  Thy Father--anything to thee!     Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace  Hath led me to this lonely place.  Joy have I had; and going hence  I bear away my recompense.  In spots like these it is we prize  Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:  Then, why should I be loth to stir?  I feel this place was made for her;  To give new pleasure like the past,  Continued long as life shall last.  Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,  Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;  For I, methinks, till I grow old,  As fair before me shall behold,  As I do now, the cabin small,  The lake, the bay, the waterfall;  And thee, the spirit of them all!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWritten In Very Early Youth\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCALM is all nature as a resting wheel.The kine are couched upon the dewy grass;The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass,Is cropping audibly his later meal:Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to stealO\'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky.Now, in this blank of things, a harmony,Home-felt, and home-created, comes to healThat grief for which the senses still supplyFresh food; for only then, when memory Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends! restrainThose busy cares that would allay my pain;Oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feelThe officious touch that makes me droop again.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAlas! What Boots The Long Laborious Quest\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nALAS! what boots the long laborious questOf moral prudence, sought through good and ill;Or pains abstruse-to elevate the will,And lead us on to that transcendent restWhere every passion shall the sway attestOf Reason, seated on her sovereign hill;What is it but a vain and curious skill,If sapient Germany must lie deprest,Beneath the brutal sword?-Her haughty SchoolsShall blush; and may not we with sorrow say- A few strong instincts and a few plain rules,Among the herdsmen of the Alps, have wroughtMore for mankind at this unhappy dayThen all the pride of intellect and thought?\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Sparrow\'s Nest\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBEHOLD, within the leafy shade,Those bright blue eggs together laid!On me the chance-discovered sightGleamed like a vision of delight.I started---seeming to espyThe home and sheltered bed,The Sparrow\'s dwelling, which, hard byMy Father\' house, in wet or dryMy sister Emmeline and I        Together visited.She looked at it and seemed to fear it;Dreading, tho\' wishing, to be near it:Such heart was in her, being thenA little Prattler among men.The Blessing of my later yearWas with me when a boy:She gave me eyes, she gave me ears;And humble care, and delicate fears;A heart, the fountain of sweet tears;        And love, and thought, and joy.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Two Thieves\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nO now that the genius of Bewick were mine, And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne. Then the Muses might deal with me just as they chose, For I\'d take my last leave both of verse and of prose. What feats would I work with my magical hand! Book-learning and books should be banished the land: And, for hunger and thirst and such troublesome calls, Every ale-house should then have a feast on its walls. The traveller would hang his wet clothes on a chair; Let them smoke, let them burn, not a straw would he care! For the Prodigal Son, Joseph\'s Dream and his sheaves, Oh, what would they be to my tale of two Thieves? The One, yet unbreeched, is not three birthdays old, His Grandsire that age more than thirty times told; There are ninety good seasons of fair and foul weather Between them, and both go a-pilfering together. With chips is the carpenter strewing his floor? Is a cart-load of turf at an old woman\'s door? Old Daniel his hand to the treasure will slide! And his Grandson\'s as busy at work by his side. Old Daniel begins; he stops short--and his eye, Through the lost look of dotage, is cunning and sly: \'Tis a look which at this time is hardly his own, But tells a plain tale of the days that are flown. He once had a heart which was moved by the wires Of manifold pleasures and many desires: And what if he cherished his purse? \'Twas no more Than treading a path trod by thousands before. \'Twas a path trod by thousands; but Daniel is one Who went something farther than others have gone, And now with old Daniel you see how it fares; You see to what end he has brought his grey hairs. The pair sally forth hand in hand: ere the sun Has peered o\'er the beeches, their work is begun: And yet, into whatever sin they may fall, This child but half knows it, and that, not at all. They hunt through the streets with deliberate tread, And each, in his turn, becomes leader or led; And, wherever they carry their plots and their wiles, Every face in the village is dimpled with smiles. Neither checked by the rich nor the needy they roam; For the grey-headed Sire has a daughter at home, Who will gladly repair all the damage that\'s done; And three, were it asked, would be rendered for one. Old Man! whom so oft I with pity have eyed, I love thee, and love the sweet Boy at thy side: Long yet may\'st thou live! for a teacher we see That lifts up the veil of our nature in thee.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo My Sister\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIt is the first mild day of March: Each minute sweeter than before The redbreast sings from the tall larch That stands beside our door. There is a blessing in the air, Which seems a sense of joy to yield To the bare trees, and mountains bare, And grass in the green field. My sister! (\'tis a wish of mine) Now that our morning meal is done, Make haste, your morning task resign; Come forth and feel the sun. Edward will come with you;--and, pray, Put on with speed your woodland dress; And bring no book: for this one day We\'ll give to idleness. No joyless forms shall regulate Our living calendar: We from to-day, my Friend, will date The opening of the year. Love, now a universal birth, From heart to heart is stealing, From earth to man, from man to earth: --It is the hour of feeling. One moment now may give us more Than years of toiling reason: Our minds shall drink at every pore The spirit of the season. Some silent laws our hearts will make, Which they shall long obey: We for the year to come may take Our temper from to-day. And from the blessed power that rolls About, below, above, We\'ll frame the measure of our souls: They shall be tuned to love. Then come, my Sister! come, I pray, With speed put on your woodland dress; And bring no book: for this one day We\'ll give to idleness.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSong At The Feast Of Brougham Castle Upon The Restoration O\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n,       High in the breathless Hall the Minstrel sate,    And Emont\'s murmur mingled with the Song.--   The words of ancient time I thus translate,   A festal strain that hath been silent long:--       "From town to town, from tower to tower,       The red rose is a gladsome flower.       Her thirty years of winter past,       The red rose is revived at last;       She lifts her head for endless spring,      For everlasting blossoming:      Both roses flourish, red and white:      In love and sisterly delight      The two that were at strife are blended,      And all old troubles now are ended.--      Joy! joy to both! but most to her      Who is the flower of Lancaster!      Behold her how She smiles to-day      On this great throng, this bright array!       Fair greeting doth she send to all      From every corner of the hall;      But chiefly from above the board      Where sits in state our rightful Lord,      A Clifford to his own restored!         "They came with banner, spear, and shield;      And it was proved in Bosworth-field.      Not long the Avenger was withstood--      Earth helped him with the cry of blood:      St. George was for us, and the might      Of blessed Angels crowned the right.      Loud voice the Land has uttered forth,      We loudest in the faithful north:      Our fields rejoice, our mountains ring,      Our streams proclaim a welcoming;      Our strong-abodes and castles see      The glory of their loyalty.         "How glad is Skipton at this hour--      Though lonely, a deserted Tower;      Knight, squire, and yeoman, page and groom,      We have them at the feast of Brough\'m.      How glad Pendragon--though the sleep      Of years be on her!--She shall reap      A taste of this great pleasure, viewing      As in a dream her own renewing.      Rejoiced is Brough, right glad, I deem,      Beside her little humble stream;      And she that keepeth watch and ward      Her statelier Eden\'s course to guard;      They both are happy at this hour,      Though each is but a lonely Tower:--      But here is perfect joy and pride      For one fair House by Emont\'s side,      This day, distinguished without peer,      To see her Master and to cheer--      Him, and his Lady-mother dear!         "Oh! it was a time forlorn      When the fatherless was born--      Give her wings that she may fly,      Or she sees her infant die!      Swords that are with slaughter wild       Hunt the Mother and the Child.      Who will take them from the light?      --Yonder is a man in sight--      Yonder is a house--but where?      No, they must not enter there.      To the caves, and to the brooks,      To the clouds of heaven she looks;      She is speechless, but her eyes      Pray in ghostly agonies.      Blissful Mary, Mother mild,      Maid and Mother undefiled,      Save a Mother and her Child!         "Now who is he that bounds with joy      On Carrock\'s side, a Shepherd-boy?      No thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass      Light as the wind along the grass.      Can this be He who hither came      In secret, like a smothered flame?      O\'er whom such thankful tears were shed      For shelter, and a poor man\'s bread!      God loves the Child; and God hath willed      That those dear words should be fulfilled,      The Lady\'s words, when forced away      The last she to her Babe did say:      "My own, my own, thy fellow-guest      I may not be; but rest thee, rest,      For lowly shepherd\'s life is best!"         "Alas! when evil men are strong      No life is good, no pleasure long.      The Boy must part from Mosedale\'s groves,      And leave Blencathara\'s rugged coves,      And quit the flowers that summer brings      To Glenderamakin\'s lofty springs;      Must vanish, and his careless cheer      Be turned to heaviness and fear.      --Give Sir Lancelot Threlkeld praise!      Hear it, good man, old in days!      Thou tree of covert and of rest      For this young Bird that is distrest;      Among thy branches safe he lay,    And he was free to sport and play,    When falcons were abroad for prey.       "A recreant harp, that sings of fear    And heaviness in Clifford\'s ear!    I said, when evil men are strong,    No life is good, no pleasure long,    A weak and cowardly untruth!    Our Clifford was a happy Youth,    And thankful through a weary time,    That brought him up to manhood\'s prime.    --Again he wanders forth at will,    And tends a flock from hill to hill:    His garb is humble; ne\'er was seen    Such garb with such a noble mien;    Among the shepherd-grooms no mate    Hath he, a Child of strength and state!    Yet lacks not friends for simple glee,    Nor yet for higher sympathy.    To his side the fallow-deer    Came and rested without fear;    The eagle, lord of land and sea,     Stooped down to pay him fealty;    And both the undying fish that swim    Through Bowscale-tarn did wait on him;     The pair were servants of his eye    In their immortality;    And glancing, gleaming, dark or bright,    Moved to and fro, for his delight.    He knew the rocks which Angels haunt    Upon the mountains visitant;    He hath kenned them taking wing:    And into caves where Faeries sing    He hath entered; and been told    By Voices how men lived of old.    Among the heavens his eye can see    The face of thing that is to be;    And, if that men report him right,    His tongue could whisper words of might.    --Now another day is come,    Fitter hope, and nobler doom;    He hath thrown aside his crook,    And hath buried deep his book;    Armour rusting in his halls    On the blood of Clifford calls,--    \'Quell the Scot,\' exclaims the Lance--    Bear me to the heart of France,    Is the longing of the Shield--    Tell thy name, thou trembling field;    Field of death, where\'er thou be,    Groan thou with our victory!    Happy day, and mighty hour,    When our Shepherd, in his power,    Mailed and horsed, with lance and sword,    To his ancestors restored    Like a re-appearing Star,    Like a glory from afar    First shall head the flock of war!" Alas! the impassioned minstrel did not know How, by Heaven\'s grace, this Clifford\'s heart was framed: How he, long forced in humble walks to go, Was softened into feeling, soothed, and tamed. Love had he found in huts where poor men lie; His daily teachers had been woods and rills, The silence that is in the starry sky, The sleep that is among the lonely hills. In him the savage virtue of the Race, Revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead: Nor did he change; but kept in lofty place The wisdom which adversity had bred. Glad were the vales, and every cottage-hearth; The Shepherd-lord was honoured more and more; And, ages after he was laid in earth, "The good Lord Clifford" was the name he bore.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPower Of Music\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAN Orpheus! an Orpheus! yes, Faith may grow bold,And take to herself all the wonders of old;--Near the stately Pantheon you\'ll meet with the sameIn the street that from Oxford hath borrowed its name.His station is there; and he works on the crowd,He sways them with harmony merry and loud;He fills with his power all their hearts to the brim--Was aught ever heard like his fiddle and him?What an eager assembly! what an empire is this!The weary have life, and the hungry have bliss; The mourner is cheered, and the anxious have rest;And the guilt-burthened soul is no longer opprest.As the Moon brightens round her the clouds of the night,So He, where he stands, is a centre of light;It gleams on the face, there, of dusky-browed Jack,And the pale-visaged Baker\'s, with basket on back.That errand-bound \'Prentice was passing in haste--What matter! he\'s caught--and his time runs to waste;The Newsman is stopped, though he stops on the fret;And the half-breathless Lamplighter--he\'s in the net! The Porter sits down on the weight which he bore;The Lass with her barrow wheels hither her store;--If a thief could be here he might pilfer at ease;She sees the Musician, \'tis all that she sees!He stands, backed by the wall;--he abates not his dinHis hat gives him vigour, with boons dropping in,From the old and the young, from the poorest; and there!The one-pennied Boy has his penny to spare.O blest are the hearers, and proud be the handOf the pleasure it spreads through so thankful a band; I am glad for him, blind as he is!--all the whileIf they speak \'tis to praise, and they praise with a smile.That tall Man, a giant in bulk and in height,Not an inch of his body is free from delight;Can he keep himself still, if he would? oh, not he!The music stirs in him like wind through a tree.Mark that Cripple who leans on his crutch; like a towerThat long has leaned forward, leans hour after hour!--That Mother, whose spirit in fetters is bound,While she dandles the Babe in her arms to the sound. Now, coaches and chariots! roar on like a stream;Here are twenty souls happy as souls in a dream:They are deaf to your murmurs--they care not for you,Nor what ye are flying, nor what ye pursue!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSong For The Wandering Jew\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThough the torrents from their fountains Roar down many a craggy steep, Yet they find among the mountains Resting-places calm and deep. Clouds that love through air to hasten, Ere the storm its fury stills, Helmet-like themselves will fasten On the heads of towering hills. What, if through the frozen centre Of the Alps the Chamois bound, Yet he has a home to enter In some nook of chosen ground: And the Sea-horse, though the ocean Yield him no domestic cave, Slumbers without sense of motion, Couched upon the rocking wave. If on windy days the Raven Gambol like a dancing skiff, Not the less she loves her haven In the bosom of the cliff. The fleet Ostrich, till day closes, Vagrant over desert sands, Brooding on her eggs reposes When chill night that care demands. Day and night my toils redouble, Never nearer to the goal; Night and day, I feel the trouble Of the Wanderer in my soul.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTo Joanna\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAmid the smoke of cities did you pass The time of early youth; and there you learned, From years of quiet industry, to love The living Beings by your own fireside, With such a strong devotion, that your heart Is slow to meet the sympathies of them Who look upon the hills with tenderness, And make dear friendships with the streams and groves. Yet we, who are transgressors in this kind, Dwelling retired in our simplicity Among the woods and fields, we love you well, Joanna! and I guess, since you have been So distant from us now for two long years, That you will gladly listen to discourse, However trivial, if you thence be taught That they, with whom you once were happy, talk Familiarly of you and of old times. While I was seated, now some ten days past, Beneath those lofty firs, that overtop Their ancient neighbour, the old steeple-tower, The Vicar from his gloomy house hard by Came forth to greet me; and when he had asked, "How fares Joanna, that wild-hearted Maid! And when will she return to us?" he paused; And, after short exchange of village news, He with grave looks demanded, for what cause, Reviving obsolete idolatry, I, like a Runic Priest, in characters Of formidable size had chiselled out Some uncouth name upon the native rock, Above the Rotha, by the forest-side. --Now, by those dear immunities of heart Engendered between malice and true love, I was not loth to be so catechised, And this was my reply:--"As it befell, One summer morning we had walked abroad At break of day, Joanna and myself. --\'Twas that delightful season when the broom, Full-flowered, and visible on every steep, Along the copses runs in veins of gold. Our pathway led us on to Rotha\'s banks; And when we came in front of that tall rock That eastward looks, I there stopped short--and stood Tracing the lofty barrier with my eye From base to summit; such delight I found To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower That intermixture of delicious hues, Along so vast a surface, all at once, In one impression, by connecting force Of their own beauty, imaged in the heart. --When I had gazed perhaps two minutes\' space, Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud. The Rock, like something starting from a sleep, Took up the Lady\'s voice, and laughed again; That ancient Woman seated on Helm-crag Was ready with her cavern; Hammar-scar, And the tall Steep of Silver-how, sent forth A noise of laughter; southern Loughrigg heard, And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone; Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky Carried the Lady\'s voice,--old Skiddaw blew His speaking-trumpet;--back out of the clouds Of Glaramara southward came the voice; And Kirkstone tossed it from his misty head. --Now whether (said I to our cordial Friend, Who in the hey-day of astonishment Smiled in my face) this were in simple truth A work accomplished by the brotherhood Of ancient mountains, or my ear was touched With dreams and visionary impulses To me alone imparted, sure I am That there was a loud uproar in the hills. And, while we both were listening, to my side The fair Joanna drew, as if she wished To shelter from some object of her fear. --And hence, long afterwards, when eighteen moons Were wasted, as I chanced to walk alone Beneath this rock, at sunrise, on a calm And silent morning, I sat down, and there, In memory of affections old and true, I chiselled out in those rude characters Joanna\'s name deep in the living stone:-- And I, and all who dwell by my fireside, Have called the lovely rock, JOANNA\'S ROCK."\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSeptember, 1819\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n. Departing summer hath assumed   An aspect tenderly illumed,  The gentlest look of spring;  That calls from yonder leafy shade   Unfaded, yet prepared to fade,  A timely carolling.  No faint and hesitating trill,   Such tribute as to winter chill   The lonely redbreast pays!  Clear, loud, and lively is the din,  From social warblers gathering in  Their harvest of sweet lays. Nor doth the example fail to cheer  Me, conscious that my leaf is sere, And yellow on the bough:-  Fall, rosy garlands, from my head!  Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed  Around a younger brow! Yet will I temperately rejoice; Wide is the range, and free the choice  Of undiscordant themes; Which, haply, kindred souls may prize  Not less than vernal ecstasies, And passion\'s feverish dreams. For deathless powers to verse belong,  And they like Demi-gods are strong  On whom the Muses smile;  But some their function have disclaimed,  Best pleased with what is aptliest framed  To enervate and defile. Not such the initiatory strains  Committed to the silent plains  In Britain\'s earliest dawn:  Trembled the groves, the stars grew pale,  While all-too-daringly the veil  Of nature was withdrawn! Nor such the spirit-stirring note  When the live chords Alc\\\'caus smote, Inflamed by sense of wrong; Woe! woe to Tyrants! from the lyre  Broke threateningly, in sparkles dire  Of fierce vindictive song. And not unhallowed was the page  By wing\\\'cbd Love inscribed, to assuage  The pangs of vain pursuit; Love listening while the Lesbian Maid  With finest touch of passion swayed  Her own \\uc0\\u8710 olian lute. O ye, who patiently explore  The wreck of Herculanean lore,  What rapture! could ye seize  Some Theban fragment, or unroll  One precious, tender-hearted scroll  Of pure Simonides. That were, indeed, a genuine birth  Of poesy; a bursting forth  Of genius from the dust:  What Horace gloried to behold, What Maro loved, shall we enfold?

Yet \'they\', so blithe of heart, seemed fitFor finest tasks of earth or air:Wings let them have, and they might flitPrecursors to Aurora\'s car,Scattering fresh flowers; though happier far, I ween,To hunt their fluttering game o\'er rock and level green.They dart across my path-but lo,Each ready with a plaintive whine!Said I, \'not half an hour agoYour Mother has had alms of mine.\' \'That cannot be,\' one answered-\'she is dead:\'-I looked reproof-they saw-but neither hung his head.\'She has been dead, Sir, many a day.\'-\'Hush, boys! you\'re telling me a lie;It was your Mother, as I say!\'And, in the twinkling of an eye,\'Come!

For this, didst Thou,   O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains   Near my \'sweet Birthplace\', didst thou, beauteous Stream   Make ceaseless music through the night and day  Which with its steady cadence, tempering  Our human waywardness, compos\'d my thoughts  To more than infant softness, giving me,  Among the fretful dwellings of mankind,  A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm  That Nature breathes among the hills and groves.  When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers  Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came,  Behind my Father\'s House he pass\'d, close by,  Along the margin of our Terrace Walk.  He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov\'d.  Oh! many a time have I, a five years\' Child,  A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill,  A little Mill-race sever\'d from his stream,  Made one long bathing of a summer\'s day,  Bask\'d in the sun, and plunged, and bask\'d again  Alternate all a summer\'s day, or cours\'d  Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves  Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,  The woods, and distant Skiddaw\'s lofty height,  Were bronz\'d with a deep radiance, stood alone  Beneath the sky, as if I had been born  On Indian Plains, and from my Mother\'s hut  Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport,  A naked Savage, in the thunder shower.      Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up  Foster\'d alike by beauty and by fear;  Much favour\'d in my birthplace, and no less  In that beloved Vale to which, erelong,  I was transplanted. Well I call to mind  (\'Twas at an early age, ere I had seen  Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope  The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp\'d  The last autumnal crocus, \'twas my joy  To wander half the night among the Cliffs  And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran  Along the open turf. In thought and wish  That time, my shoulder all with springes hung,  I was a fell destroyer. On the heights  Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied  My anxious visitation, hurrying on,  Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars  Were shining o\'er my head; I was alone,  And seem\'d to be a trouble to the peace  That was among them. Sometimes it befel  In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire  O\'erpower\'d my better reason, and the bird  Which was the captive of another\'s toils  Became my prey; and, when the deed was done  I heard among the solitary hills   Low breathings coming after me, and sounds  Of undistinguishable motion, steps  Almost as silent as the turf they trod.  Nor less in springtime when on southern banks  The shining sun had from his knot of leaves  Decoy\'d the primrose flower, and when the Vales  And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then  In the high places, on the lonesome peaks  Where\'er, among the mountains and the winds,  The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean  My object, and inglorious, yet the end  Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung  Above the raven\'s nest, by knots of grass  And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock  But ill sustain\'d, and almost, as it seem\'d,  Suspended by the blast which blew amain,  Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time,  While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,  With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind  Blow through my ears! the sky seem\'d not a sky  Of earth, and with what motion mov\'d the clouds!      The mind of Man is fram\'d even like the breath  And harmony of music. There is a dark  Invisible workmanship that reconciles  Discordant elements, and makes them move  In one society. Ah me! that all  The terrors, all the early miseries  Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all  The thoughts and feelings which have been infus\'d  Into my mind, should ever have made up  The calm existence that is mine when I  Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end!  Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe  That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame  A favor\'d Being, from his earliest dawn  Of infancy doth open out the clouds,  As at the touch of lightning, seeking him  With gentlest visitation; not the less,  Though haply aiming at the self-same end,  Does it delight her sometimes to employ Severer interventions, ministry More palpable, and so she dealt with me.    One evening (surely I was led by her) I went alone into a Shepherd\'s Boat, A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied Within a rocky Cave, its usual home. \'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays. Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff, Discover\'d thus by unexpected chance, Than I unloos\'d her tether and embark\'d. The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore I push\'d, and struck the oars and struck again In cadence, and my little Boat mov\'d on Even like a Man who walks with stately step Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth And troubled pleasure; not without the voice Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on, Leaving behind her still on either side Small circles glittering idly in the moon, Until they melted all into one track Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose Above the Cavern of the Willow tree And now, as suited one who proudly row\'d With his best skill, I fix\'d a steady view Upon the top of that same craggy ridge, The bound of the horizon, for behind Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily I dipp\'d my oars into the silent Lake, And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat Went heaving through the water, like a Swan; When from behind that craggy Steep, till then The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff, As if with voluntary power instinct, Uprear\'d its head. I struck, and struck again And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff Rose up between me and the stars, and still, With measur\'d motion, like a living thing, Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn\'d, And through the silent water stole my way Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree. There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark, And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave And serious thoughts; and after I had seen That spectacle, for many days, my brain Work\'d with a dim and undetermin\'d sense Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts There was a darkness, call it solitude, Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes Of hourly objects, images of trees, Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields; But huge and mighty Forms that do not live Like living men mov\'d slowly through the mind By day and were the trouble of my dreams.    Wisdom and Spirit of the universe! Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought! That giv\'st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion! not in vain, By day or star-light thus from my first dawn Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human Soul, Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man, But with high objects, with enduring things, With life and nature, purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying, by such discipline, Both pain and fear, until we recognize A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.    Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf\'d to me With stinted kindness. In November days, When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods At noon, and \'mid the calm of summer nights, When, by the margin of the trembling Lake, Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went In solitude, such intercourse was mine; \'Twas mine among the fields both day and night, And by the waters all the summer long.    And in the frosty season, when the sun Was set, and visible for many a mile The cottage windows through the twilight blaz\'d, I heeded not the summons:--happy time It was, indeed, for all of us; to me It was a time of rapture: clear and loud The village clock toll\'d six; I wheel\'d about, Proud and exulting, like an untired horse, That cares not for its home.--All shod with steel, We hiss\'d along the polish\'d ice, in games Confederate, imitative of the chace And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. So through the darkness and the cold we flew, And not a voice was idle; with the din, Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud, The leafless trees, and every icy crag Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away.    Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay, or sportively Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, To cut across the image of a star That gleam\'d upon the ice: and oftentimes When we had given our bodies to the wind, And all the shadowy banks, on either side, Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still The rapid line of motion; then at once Have I, reclining back upon my heels, Stopp\'d short, yet still the solitary Cliffs Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll\'d With visible motion her diurnal round; Behind me did they stretch in solemn train Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch\'d Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.    Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills! And Souls of lonely places! can I think A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ\'d Such ministry, when Ye through many a year Haunting me thus among my boyish sports, On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, Impress\'d upon all forms the characters Of danger or desire, and thus did make The surface of the universal earth With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, Work like a sea?       Not uselessly employ\'d, I might pursue this theme through every change Of exercise and play, to which the year Did summon us in its delightful round.    We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours, Nor saw a race in happiness and joy More worthy of the ground where they were sown. I would record with no reluctant voice The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line, True symbol of the foolishness of hope, Which with its strong enchantment led us on By rocks and pools, shut out from every star All the green summer, to forlorn cascades Among the windings of the mountain brooks. --Unfading recollections! at this hour The heart is almost mine with which I felt From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser, Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days, Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly Dash\'d headlong; and rejected by the storm.    Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt, A ministration of your own was yours, A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love! Can I forget you, being as ye were So beautiful among the pleasant fields In which ye stood? Or can I here forget The plain and seemly countenance with which Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye Delights and exultations of your own. Eager and never weary we pursued Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire At evening; when with pencil and with slate, In square divisions parcell\'d out, and all With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o\'er, We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head In strife too humble to be named in Verse. Or round the naked table, snow-white deal, Cherry or maple, sate in close array, And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world Neglected and ungratefully thrown by Even for the very service they had wrought, But husbanded through many a long campaign. Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards, Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth Had glorified, and call\'d to represent The persons of departed Potentates. Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell! Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, A congregation piteously akin. Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit, Those sooty knaves, precipitated down With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven, The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse, Queens, gleaming through their splendour\'s last decay, And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain\'d By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad The heavy rain was falling, or the frost Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth, And, interrupting oft the impassion\'d game, From Esthwaite\'s neighbouring Lake the splitting ice, While it sank down towards the water, sent, Among the meadows and the hills, its long And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves When they are howling round the Bothnic Main.    Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace How Nature by extrinsic passion first Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand, And made me love them, may I well forget How other pleasures have been mine, and joys Of subtler origin; how I have felt, Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time, Those hallow\'d and pure motions of the sense Which seem, in their simplicity, to own An intellectual charm, that calm delight Which, if I err not, surely must belong To those first-born affinities that fit Our new existence to existing things, And, in our dawn of being, constitute The bond of union betwixt life and joy.    Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth, And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp\'d The faces of the moving year, even then, A Child, I held unconscious intercourse With the eternal Beauty, drinking in A pure organic pleasure from the lines Of curling mist, or from the level plain Of waters colour\'d by the steady clouds.    The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays Of Cumbria\'s rocky limits, they can tell How when the Sea threw off his evening shade And to the Shepherd\'s huts beneath the crags Did send sweet notice of the rising moon, How I have stood, to fancies such as these, Engrafted in the tenderness of thought, A stranger, linking with the spectacle No conscious memory of a kindred sight, And bringing with me no peculiar sense Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood, Even while mine eye has mov\'d o\'er three long leagues Of shining water, gathering, as it seem\'d, Through every hair-breadth of that field of light, New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.    Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy Which, through all seasons, on a child\'s pursuits Are prompt attendants, \'mid that giddy bliss Which, like a tempest, works along the blood And is forgotten; even then I felt Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth And common face of Nature spake to me Rememberable things; sometimes, \'tis true, By chance collisions and quaint accidents Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos\'d Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain Nor profitless, if haply they impress\'d Collateral objects and appearances, Albeit lifeless then, and doom\'d to sleep Until maturer seasons call\'d them forth To impregnate and to elevate the mind. --And if the vulgar joy by its own weight Wearied itself out of the memory, The scenes which were a witness of that joy Remained, in their substantial lineaments Depicted on the brain, and to the eye Were visible, a daily sight; and thus By the impressive discipline of fear, By pleasure and repeated happiness, So frequently repeated, and by force Of obscure feelings representative Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes, So beauteous and majestic in themselves, Though yet the day was distant, did at length Become habitually dear, and all Their hues and forms were by invisible links Allied to the affections.       I began My story early, feeling as I fear, The weakness of a human love, for days Disown\'d by memory, ere the birth of spring Planting my snowdrops among winter snows. Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt In sympathy, that I have lengthen\'d out, With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale. Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch Invigorating thoughts from former years, Might fix the wavering balance of my wind, And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power May spur me on, in manhood now mature, To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught To understand myself, nor thou to know With better knowledge how the heart was fram\'d Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit Those recollected hours that have the charm Of visionary things, and lovely forms And sweet sensations that throw back our life And almost make our Infancy itself A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?    One end hereby at least hath been attain\'d, My mind hath been revived, and if this mood Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down, Through later years, the story of my life. The road lies plain before me; \'tis a theme Single and of determined bounds; and hence I chuse it rather at this time, than work Of ampler or more varied argument.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe French Revolution As It Appeared To Enthusiasts\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!    For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood   Upon our side, we who were strong in love!   Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,   But to be young was very heaven!--Oh! times,   In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways   Of custom, law, and statute, took at once   The attraction of a country in romance!   When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,  When most intent on making of herself  A prime Enchantress--to assist the work  Which then was going forward in her name!  Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth,  The beauty wore of promise, that which sets  (As at some moment might not be unfelt  Among the bowers of paradise itself )  The budding rose above the rose full blown.  What temper at the prospect did not wake  To happiness unthought of? The inert  Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!  They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,  The playfellows of fancy, who had made  All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength  Their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred  Among the grandest objects of the sense,  And dealt with whatsoever they found there  As if they had within some lurking right  To wield it;--they, too, who, of gentle mood,  Had watched all gentle motions, and to these  Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more wild,  And in the region of their peaceful selves;--  Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty  Did both find, helpers to their heart\'s desire,  And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;  Wcre called upon to exercise their skill,  Not in Utopia, subterranean fields,  Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!  But in the very world, which is the world  Of all of us,--the place where in the end  We find our happiness, or not at all!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMinstrels\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe minstrels played their Christmas tuneTo-night beneath my cottage-eaves;While, smitten by a lofty moon,The encircling laurels, thick with leaves,Gave back a rich and dazzling sheen,That overpowered their natural green.Through hill and valley every breezeHad sunk to rest with folded wings:Keen was the air, but could not freeze,Nor check, the music of the strings;So stout and hardy were the bandThat scraped the chords with strenuous hand.And who but listened?-till was paidRespect to every inmate\'s claim,The greeting given, the music playedIn honour of each household name,Duly pronounced with lusty call,And \'Merry Christmas\' wished to all.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFidelity\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA BARKING sound the Shepherd hears,A cry as of a dog or fox;He halts--and searches with his eyesAmong the scattered rocks:And now at distance can discernA stirring in a brake of fern;And instantly a dog is seen,Glancing through that covert green.The Dog is not of mountain breed;Its motions, too, are wild and shy; With something, as the Shepherd thinks,Unusual in its cry:Nor is there any one in sightAll round, in hollow or on height;Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear;What is the creature doing here?It was a cove, a huge recess,That keeps, till June, December\'s snow;A lofty precipice in front,A silent tarn below! Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,Remote from public road or dwelling,Pathway, or cultivated land;From trace of human foot or hand.There sometimes doth a leaping fishSend through the tarn a lonely cheer;The crags repeat the raven\'s croak,In symphony austere;Thither the rainbow comes--the cloud--And mists that spread the flying shroud; And sunbeams; and the sounding blast,That, if it could, would hurry past;But that enormous barrier holds it fast.Not free from boding thoughts, a whileThe Shepherd stood; then makes his wayO\'er rocks and stones, following the DogAs quickly as he may;Nor far had gone before he foundA human skeleton on the ground;The appalled Discoverer with a sigh Looks round, to learn the history.From those abrupt and perilous rocksThe Man had fallen, that place of fear!At length upon the Shepherd\'s mindIt breaks, and all is clear:He instantly recalled the name,And who he was, and whence he came;Remembered, too, the very dayOn which the Traveller passed this way.But hear a wonder, for whose sake This lamentable tale I tell!A lasting monument of wordsThis wonder merits well.The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,Repeating the same timid cry,This Dog, had been through three months\' spaceA dweller in that savage place.Yes, proof was plain that, since the dayWhen this ill-fated Traveller died,The Dog had watched about the spot, Or by his master\'s side:How nourished here through such long timeHe knows, who gave that love sublime;And gave that strength of feeling, greatAbove all human estimate!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBook Eighth: Retrospect--Love Of Nature Leading To Love Of Man\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHAT sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heardUp to thy summit, through the depth of airAscending, as if distance had the powerTo make the sounds more audible? What crowdCovers, or sprinkles o\'er, yon village green?Crowd seems it, solitary hill! to thee,Though but a little family of men,Shepherds and tillers of the ground--betimesAssembled with their children and their wives,And here and there a stranger interspersed. They hold a rustic fair--a festival,Such as, on this side now, and now on that,Repeated through his tributary vales,Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,Sees annually, if clouds towards either oceanBlown from their favourite resting-place, or mistsDissolved, have left him an unshrouded head.Delightful day it is for all who dwellIn this secluded glen, and eagerlyThey give it welcome. Long ere heat of noon, From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheepAre penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.The heifer lows, uneasy at the voiceOf a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;A lame man or a blind, the one to beg,The other to make music; hither, too,From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,Of hawker\'s wares--books, pictures, combs, and pins--Some aged woman finds her way again, Year after year, a punctual visitant!There also stands a speech-maker by rote,Pulling the strings of his boxed raree-show;And in the lapse of many years may comeProuder itinerant, mountebank, or heWhose wonders in a covered wain lie hid.But one there is, the loveliest of them all,Some sweet lass of the valley, looking outFor gains, and who that sees her would not buy?Fruits of her father\'s orchard are her wares, And with the ruddy produce she walks roundAmong the crowd, half pleased with, half ashamedOf, her new office, blushing restlessly.The children now are rich, for the old to-dayAre generous as the young; and, if contentWith looking on, some ancient wedded pairSit in the shade together; while they gaze,\'A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,The days departed start again to life,And all the scenes of childhood reappear, Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sunTo him who slept at noon and wakes at eve.\'Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,Spreading from young to old, from old to young,And no one seems to want his share.--ImmenseIs the recess, the circumambient worldMagnificent, by which they are embraced:They move about upon the soft green turf:How little they, they and their doings, seem,And all that they can further or obstruct! Through utter weakness pitiably dear,As tender infants are: and yet how great!For all things serve them: them the morning lightLoves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;And them the silent rocks, which now from highLook down upon them; the reposing clouds;The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts;And old Helvellyn, conscious of the stirWhich animates this day their calm abode.With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel, In that enormous City\'s turbulent worldOf men and things, what benefit I owedTo thee, and those domains of rural peace,Where to the sense of beauty first my heartWas opened; tract more exquisitely fairThan that famed paradise of ten thousand trees,Or Gehol\'s matchless gardens, for delightOf the Tartarian dynasty composed(Beyond that mighty wall, not fabulous,China\'s stupendous mound) by patient toil Of myriads and boon nature\'s lavish help;There, in a clime from widest empire chosen,Fulfilling (could enchantment have done more?)A sumptuous dream of flowery lawns, with domesOf pleasure sprinkled over, shady dellsFor eastern monasteries, sunny mountsWith temples crested, bridges, gondolas,Rocks, dens, and groves of foliage taught to meltInto each other their obsequious hues,Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase, Too fine to be pursued; or standing forthIn no discordant opposition, strongAnd gorgeous as the colours side by sideBedded among rich plumes of tropic birds;And mountains over all, embracing all;And all the landscape, endlessly enrichedWith waters running, falling, or asleep.But lovelier far than this, the paradiseWhere I was reared; in Nature\'s primitive giftsFavoured no less, and more to every sense Delicious, seeing that the sun and sky,The elements, and seasons as they change,Do find a worthy fellow-labourer there--Man free, man working for himself, with choiceOf time, and place, and object; by his wants,His comforts, native occupations, cares,Cheerfully led to individual endsOr social, and still followed by a trainUnwooed, unthought-of even--simplicity,And beauty, and inevitable grace. Yea, when a glimpse of those imperial bowersWould to a child be transport over-great,When but a half-hour\'s roam through such a placeWould leave behind a dance of images,That shall break in upon his sleep for weeks;Even then the common haunts of the green earth,And ordinary interests of man,Which they embosom, all without regardAs both may seem, are fastening on the heartInsensibly, each with the other\'s help. For me, when my affections first were ledFrom kindred, friends, and playmates, to partakeLove for the human creature\'s absolute self,That noticeable kindliness of heartSprang out of fountains, there abounding most,Where sovereign Nature dictated the tasksAnd occupations which her beauty adorned,And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;Not such as Saturn ruled \'mid Latian wilds,With arts and laws so tempered, that their lives Left, even to us toiling in this late day,A bright tradition of the golden age;Not such as, \'mid Arcadian fastnessesSequestered, handed down among themselvesFelicity, in Grecian song renowned;Nor such as--when an adverse fate had driven,From house and home, the courtly band whose fortunesEntered, with Shakspeare\'s genius, the wild woodsOf Arden--amid sunshine or in shadeCulled the best fruits of Time\'s uncounted hours, Ere Phoebe sighed for the false Ganymede;Or there where Perdita and FlorizelTogether danced, Queen of the feast, and King;Nor such as Spenser fabled. True it is,That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen)Of maids at sunrise bringing in from farTheir May-bush, and along the streets in flocksParading with a song of taunting rhymes,Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;Had also heard, from those who yet remembered, Tales of the May-pole dance, and wreaths that deckedPorch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of youths,Each with his maid, before the sun was up,By annual custom, issuing forth in troops,To drink the waters of some sainted well,And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:The times, too sage, perhaps too proud, have droppedThese lighter graces; and the rural waysAnd manners which my childhood looked upon Were the unluxuriant produce of a lifeIntent on little but substantial needs,Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.But images of danger and distress,Man suffering among awful Powers and Forms;Of this I heard, and saw enough to makeImagination restless; nor was freeMyself from frequent perils; nor were talesWanting,--the tragedies of former times,Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks Immutable, and everflowing streams,Where\'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,Long springs and tepid winters, on the banksOf delicate Galesus; and no lessThose scattered along Adria\'s myrtle shores:Smooth life had herdsman, and his snow-white herdTo triumphs and to sacrificial ritesDevoted, on the inviolable streamOf rich Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived As calmly, underneath the pleasant browsOf cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heardOf Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocksWith tutelary music, from all harmThe fold protecting, I myself, matureIn manhood then, have seen a pastoral tractLike one of these, where Fancy might run wild,Though under skies less generous, less serene:There, for her own delight had Nature framedA pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse Of level pasture, islanded with grovesAnd banked with woody risings; but the PlainEndless, here opening widely out, and thereShut up in lesser lakes or beds of lawnAnd intricate recesses, creek or baySheltered within a shelter, where at largeThe shepherd strays, a rolling hut his home.Thither he comes with spring-time, there abidesAll summer, and at sunrise ye may hearHis flageolet to liquid notes of love Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding far.Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast spaceWhere passage opens, but the same shall haveIn turn its visitant, telling there his hoursIn unlaborious pleasure, with no taskMore toilsome than to carve a beechen bowlFor spring or fountain, which the traveller finds,When through the region he pursues at willHis devious course. A glimpse of such sweet lifeI saw when, from the melancholy walls Of Goslar, once imperial, I renewedMy daily walk along that wide champaign,That, reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,And northwards, from beneath the mountainous vergeOf the Hercynian forest. Yet, hail to youMoors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic\'s voice,Powers of my native region! Ye that seizeThe heart with firmer grasp! Your snows and streamsUngovernable, and your terrifying winds, That howl so dismally for him who treadsCompanionless your awful solitudes!There, \'tis the shepherd\'s task the winter longTo wait upon the storms: of their approachSagacious, into sheltering coves he drivesHis flock, and thither from the homestead bearsA toilsome burden up the craggy ways,And deals it out, their regular nourishmentStrewn on the frozen snow. And when the springLooks out, and all the pastures dance with lambs, And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbsHigher and higher, him his office leadsTo watch their goings, whatsoever trackThe wanderers choose. For this he quits his homeAt day-spring, and no sooner doth the sunBegin to strike him with a fire-like heat,Than he lies down upon some shining rock,And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,As is their wont, a pittance from strict time,For rest not needed or exchange of love, Then from his couch he starts; and now his feetCrush out a livelier fragrance from the flowersOf lowly thyme, by Nature\'s skill enwroughtIn the wild turf: the lingering dews of mornSmoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,His staff protending like a hunter\'s spear,Or by its aid leaping from crag to crag,And o\'er the brawling beds of unbridged streams.Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy\'s call,Might deign to follow him through what he does Or sees in his day\'s march; himself he feels,In those vast regions where his service lies,A freeman, wedded to his life of hopeAnd hazard, and hard labour interchangedWith that majestic indolence so dearTo native man. A rambling schoolboy, thus,I felt his presence in his own domain,As of a lord and master, or a power,Or genius, under Nature, under God,Presiding; and severest solitude Had more commanding looks when he was there.When up the lonely brooks on rainy daysAngling I went, or trod the trackless hillsBy mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyesHave glanced upon him distant a few steps,In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he steppedBeyond the boundary line of some hill-shadow,His form hath flashed upon me, glorifiedBy the deep radiance of the setting sun: Or him have I descried in distant sky,A solitary object and sublime,Above all height! like an aerial crossStationed alone upon a spiry rockOf the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was manEnnobled outwardly before my sight,And thus my heart was early introducedTo an unconscious love and reverenceOf human nature; hence the human formTo me became an index of delight, Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.Meanwhile this creature--spiritual almostAs those of books, but more exalted far;Far more of an imaginative formThan the gay Corin of the groves, who livesFor his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst--Was, for the purposes of kind, a manWith the most common; husband, father; learned,Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;Of this I little saw, cared less for it,But something must have felt.Call ye these appearances--Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,This sanctity of Nature given to man--A shadow, a delusion, ye who poreOn the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;Whose truth is not a motion or a shapeInstinct with vital functions, but a blockOr waxen image which yourselves have made, And ye adore! But blessed be the GodOf Nature and of Man that this was so;That men before my inexperienced eyesDid first present themselves thus purified,Removed, and to a distance that was fit:And so we all of us in some degreeAre led to knowledge, wheresoever led,And howsoever; were it otherwise,And we found evil fast as we find goodIn our first years, or think that it is found, How could the innocent heart bear up and live!But doubly fortunate my lot; not hereAlone, that something of a better lifePerhaps was round me than it is the privilegeOf most to move in, but that first I lookedAt Man through objects that were great or fair;First communed with him by their help. And thusWas founded a sure safeguard and defenceAgainst the weight of meanness, selfish cares,Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in On all sides from the ordinary worldIn which we traffic. Starting from this pointI had my face turned toward the truth, beganWith an advantage furnished by that kindOf prepossession, without which the soulReceives no knowledge that can bring forth good,No genuine insight ever comes to her.From the restraint of over-watchful eyesPreserved, I moved about, year after year,Happy, and now most thankful that my walk Was guarded from too early intercourseWith the deformities of crowded life,And those ensuing laughters and contempts,Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to thinkWith a due reverence on earth\'s rightful lord,Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,That to devotion willingly would rise,Into the temple and the temple\'s heart.Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me Thus early took a place pre-eminent;Nature herself was, at this unripe time,But secondary to my own pursuitsAnd animal activities, and allTheir trivial pleasures; and when these had droopedAnd gradually expired, and Nature, prizedFor her own sake, became my joy, even then--And upwards through late youth, until not lessThan two-and-twenty summers had been told--Was Man in my affections and regards Subordinate to her, her visible formsAnd viewless agencies: a passion, she,A rapture often, and immediate loveEver at hand; he, only a delightOccasional, an accidental grace,His hour being not yet come. Far less had thenThe inferior creatures, beast or bird, attunedMy spirit to that gentleness of love,(Though they had long been carefully observed),Won from me those minute obeisances Of tenderness, which I may number nowWith my first blessings. Nevertheless, on theseThe light of beauty did not fall in vain,Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.But when that first poetic facultyOf plain Imagination and severe,No longer a mute influence of the soul,Ventured, at some rash Muse\'s earnest call,To try her strength among harmonious words;And to book-notions and the rules of art Did knowingly conform itself; there cameAmong the simple shapes of human lifeA wilfulness of fancy and conceit;And Nature and her objects beautifiedThese fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,They burnished her. From touch of this new powerNothing was safe: the elder-tree that grewBeside the well-known charnel-house had thenA dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,That took his station there for ornament: The dignities of plain occurrence thenWere tasteless, and truth\'s golden mean, a pointWhere no sufficient pleasure could be found.Then, if a widow, staggering with the blowOf her distress, was known to have turned her stepsTo the cold grave in which her husband slept,One night, or haply more than one, through painOr half-insensate impotence of mind,The fact was caught at greedily, and thereShe must be visitant the whole year through, Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.Through quaint obliquities I might pursueThese cravings; when the foxglove, one by one,Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,Had shed beside the public way its bells,And stood of all dismantled, save the lastLeft at the tapering ladder\'s top, that seemedTo bend as doth a slender blade of grassTipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still With this last relic, soon itself to fall,Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,All unconcerned by her dejected plight,Laughed as with rival eagerness their handsGathered the purple cups that round them lay,Strewing the turfs green slope.A diamond light(Whene\'er the summer sun, declining, smoteA smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seenSparkling from out a copse-clad bank that roseFronting our cottage. Oft beside the hearth Seated, with open door, often and longUpon this restless lustre have I gazed,That made my fancy restless as itself.\'Twas now for me a burnished silver shieldSuspended over a knight\'s tomb, who layInglorious, buried in the dusky wood:An entrance now into some magic caveOr palace built by fairies of the rock;Nor could I have been bribed to disenchantThe spectacle, by visiting the spot. Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bredBy pure Imagination: busy PowerShe was, and with her ready pupil turnedInstinctively to human passions, thenLeast understood. Yet, \'mid the fervent swarmOf these vagaries, with an eye so richAs mine was through the bounty of a grandAnd lovely region, I had forms distinctTo steady me: each airy thought revolved Round a substantial centre, which at onceIncited it to motion, and controlled.I did not pine like one in cities bred,As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend!Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreamsOf sickliness, disjoining, joining, thingsWithout the light of knowledge. Where the harm,If, when the woodman languished with diseaseInduced by sleeping nightly on the groundWithin his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise, I called the pangs of disappointed love,And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,If not already from the woods retiredTo die at home, was haply, as I knew,Withering by slow degrees, \'mid gentle airs,Birds, running streams, and hills so beautifulOn golden evenings, while the charcoal pileBreathed up its smoke, an image of his ghostOr spirit that full soon must take her flight. Nor shall we not be tending towards that pointOf sound humanity to which our TaleLeads, though by sinuous ways, if here I showHow Fancy, in a season when she woveThose slender cords, to guide the unconscious BoyFor the Man\'s sake, could feed at Nature\'s callSome pensive musings which might well beseemMaturer years.A grove there is whose boughsStretch from the western marge of ThurstonmereWith length of shade so thick, that whoso glides Along the line of low-roofed water, movesAs in a cloister. Once--while, in that shadeLoitering, I watched the golden beams of lightFlung from the setting sun, as they reposedIn silent beauty on the naked ridgeOf a high eastern hill--thus flowed my thoughtsIn a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:Dear native Regions, wheresoe\'er shall closeMy mortal course, there will I think on you;Dying, will cast on you a backward look; Even as this setting sun (albeit the ValeIs no where touched by one memorial gleam)Doth with the fond remains of his last powerStill linger, and a farewell lustre sheds,On the dear mountain-tops where first he rose.Enough of humble arguments; recall,My Song! those high emotions which thy voiceHas heretofore made known; that bursting forthOf sympathy, inspiring and inspired,When everywhere a vital pulse was felt, And all the several frames of things, like stars,Through every magnitude distinguishable,Shone mutually indebted, or half lostEach in the other\'s blaze, a galaxyOf life and glory. In the midst stood Man,Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,As, of all visible natures, crown, though bornOf dust, and kindred to the worm; a Being,Both in perception and discernment, firstIn every capability of rapture, Through the divine effect of power and love;As, more than anything we know, instinctWith godhead, and, by reason and by will,Acknowledging dependency sublime.Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapesOf vice and folly thrust upon my view,Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn,Manners and characters discriminate,And little bustling passions that eclipse, As well they might, the impersonated thought,The idea, or abstraction of the kind.An idler among academic bowers,Such was my new condition, as at largeHas been set forth; yet here the vulgar lightOf present, actual, superficial life,Gleaming through colouring of other times,Old usages and local privilege,Was welcomed, softened, if not solemnised.This notwithstanding, being brought more near To vice and guilt, forerunning wretchedness,I trembled,--thought, at times, of human lifeWith an indefinite terror and dismay,Such as the storms and angry elementsHad bred in me; but gloomier far, a dimAnalogy to uproar and misrule,Disquiet, danger, and obscurity.It might be told (but wherefore speak of thingsCommon to all?) that, seeing, I was ledGravely to ponder--judging between good And evil, not as for the mind\'s delightBut for her guidance--one who was to \'act\',As sometimes to the best of feeble meansI did, by human sympathy impelled:And, through dislike and most offensive pain,Was to the truth conducted; of this faithNever forsaken, that, by acting well,And understanding, I should learn to loveThe end of life, and everything we know.Grave Teacher, stern Preceptress! for at times Thou canst put on an aspect most severe;London, to thee I willingly return.Erewhile my verse played idly with the flowersEnwrought upon thy mantle; satisfiedWith that amusement, and a simple lookOf child-like inquisition now and thenCast upwards on thy countenance, to detectSome inner meanings which might harbour there.But how could I in mood so light indulge,Keeping such fresh remembrance of the day, When, having thridded the long labyrinthOf the suburban villages, I firstEntered thy vast dominion? On the roofOf an itinerant vehicle I sate,With vulgar men about me, trivial formsOf houses, pavement, streets, of men and things,--Mean shapes on every side: but, at the instant,When to myself it fairly might be said,The threshold now is overpast, (how strangeThat aught external to the living mind Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),A weight of ages did at once descendUpon my heart; no thought embodied, noDistinct remembrances, but weight and power,--Power growing under weight: alas! I feelThat I am trifling: \'twas a moment\'s pause,--All that took place within me came and wentAs in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,And grateful memory, as a thing divine.The curious traveller, who, from open day, Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,The Grotto of Antiparos, or the DenIn old time haunted by that Danish Witch,Yordas; he looks around and sees the vaultWidening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,Erelong, the massy roof above his head,That instantly unsettles and recedes,--Substance and shadow, light and darkness, allCommingled, making up a canopyOf shapes and forms and tendencies to shape That shift and vanish, change and interchangeLike spectres,--ferment silent and sublime!That after a short space works less and less,Till, every effort, every motion gone,The scene before him stands in perfect viewExposed, and lifeless as a written book!--But let him pause awhile, and look again,And a new quickening shall succeed, at firstBeginning timidly, then creeping fast,Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass, Busies the eye with images and formsBoldly assembled,--here is shadowed forthFrom the projections, wrinkles, cavities,A variegated landscape,--there the shapeOf some gigantic warrior clad in mail,The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk,Veiled nun, or pilgrim resting on his staff:Strange congregation! yet not slow to meetEyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.Even in such sort had I at first been moved, Nor otherwise continued to be moved,As I explored the vast metropolis,Fount of my country\'s destiny and the world\'s;That great emporium, chronicle at onceAnd burial-place of passions, and their homeImperial, their chief living residence.With strong sensations teeming as it didOf past and present, such a place must needsHave pleased me, seeking knowledge at that timeFar less than craving power; yet knowledge came, Sought or unsought, and influxes of powerCame, of themselves, or at her call derivedIn fits of kindliest apprehensiveness,From all sides, when whate\'er was in itselfCapacious found, or seemed to find, in meA correspondent amplitude of mind;Such is the strength and glory of our youth!The human nature unto which I feltThat I belonged, and reverenced with love,Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit Diffused through time and space, with aid derivedOf evidence from monuments, erect,Prostrate, or leaning towards their common restIn earth, the widely scattered wreck sublimeOf vanished nations, or more clearly drawnFrom books and what they picture and record.\'Tis true, the history of our native land--With those of Greece compared and popular Rome,And in our high-wrought modern narrativesStript of their harmonising soul, the life Of manners and familiar incidents--Had never much delighted me. And lessThan other intellects had mine been usedTo lean upon extrinsic circumstanceOf record or tradition; but a senseOf what in the Great City had been doneAnd suffered, and was doing, suffering, still,Weighed with me, could support the test of thought;And, in despite of all that had gone by,Or was departing never to return, There I conversed with majesty and powerLike independent natures. Hence the placeWas thronged with impregnations like the WildsIn which my early feelings had been nursed--Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns, rocks,And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,Echoes and waterfalls, and pointed cragsThat into music touch the passing wind.Here then my young imagination foundNo uncongenial element; could here Among new objects serve or give command,Even as the heart\'s occasions might require,To forward reason\'s else too-scrupulous march.The effect was, still more elevated viewsOf human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,Debasement undergone by body or mind,Nor all the misery forced upon my sight,Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scannedMost feelingly, could overthrow my trustIn what we \'may\' become; induce belief That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,A solitary, who with vain conceitsHad been inspired, and walked about in dreams.From those sad scenes when meditation turned,Lo! everything that was indeed divineRetained its purity inviolate,Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloomSet off; such opposition as arousedThe mind of Adam, yet in ParadiseThough fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw Darkness ere day\'s mid course, and morning lightMore orient in the western cloud, that drewO\'er the blue firmament a radiant white,Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.Add also, that among the multitudesOf that huge city, oftentimes was seenAffectingly set forth, more than elsewhereIs possible, the unity of man,One spirit over ignorance and vicePredominant, in good and evil hearts; One sense for moral judgments, as one eyeFor the sun\'s light. The soul when smitten thusBy a sublime \'idea\', whencesoe\'erVouchsafed for union or communion, feedsOn the pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.Thus from a very early age, O Friend!My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawnTo human-kind, and to the good and illOf human life: Nature had led me on;And oft amid the \'busy hum\' I seemed To travel independent of her help,As if I had forgotten her; but no,The world of human-kind outweighed not hersIn my habitual thoughts; the scale of love,Though filling daily, still was light, comparedWith that in which \'her\' mighty objects lay.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Green Linnet\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBENEATH these fruit-tree boughs that shedTheir snow-white blossoms on my head,With brightest sunshine round me spread       Of spring\'s unclouded weather,In this sequestered nook how sweetTo sit upon my orchard-seat!And birds and flowers once more to greet,       My last year\'s friends together.One have I marked, the happiest guestIn all this covert of the blest:Hail to Thee, far above the rest       In joy of voice and pinion!Thou, Linnet! in thy green array,Presiding Spirit here today,Dost lead the revels of the May;       And this is thy dominion.While bird, and butterflies, and flowers,Make all one band of paramours,Thou, ranging up and down the bowers,       Art sole in thy employment:A Life, a Presence like the Air,Scattering thy gladness without care,Too blest with any one to pair;       Thyself thy own enjoyment.Amid yon tuft of hazel trees,That twinkle to the gusty breeze,Behold him perched in ecstasies,       Yet seeming still to hover;There! where the flutter of his wingsUpon his back and body flingsShadows and sunny glimmerings,       That cover him all over.My dazzled sight he oft deceives,A Brother of the dancing leaves;Then flits, and from the cottage eaves       Pours forth his song in gushes;As if by that exulting strainHe mocked and treated with disdainThe voiceless Form he chose to feign,       While fluttering in the bushes.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYew-Trees\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere is a Yew-tree, pride of Lorton Vale,Which to this day stands single, in the midstOf its own darkness, as it stood of yore:Not loathe to furnish weapons for the BandsOf Umfraville or Percy ere they marchedTo Scotland\'s heaths; or those that crossed the seaAnd drew their sounding bows at Azincour,Perhaps at earlier Crecy, or Poictiers.Of vast circumference and gloom profoundThis solitary Tree! -a living thingProduced too slowly ever to decay;Of form and aspect too magnificentTo be destroyed. But worthier still of noteAre those fraternal Four of Borrowdale,Joined in one solemn and capacious grove;Huge trunks! -and each particular trunk a growthOf intertwisted fibres serpentineUp-coiling, and inveteratley convolved, - Nor uninformed with Fantasy, and looksThat threaten the profane; -a pillared shade,Upon whose grassless floor of red-brown hue,By sheddings from the pining umbrage tingedPerennially -beneath whose sable roofOf boughs, as if for festal purpose deckedWith unrejoicing berries -ghostly ShapesMay meet at noontide: Fear and trembling Hope,Silence and Foresight, Death the SkeletonAnd Time the Shadow; there to celebrate,As in a natural temple scattered o\'erWith altars undisturbed of mossy stone,United worship; or in mute reposeTo lie, and listen to the mountain floodMurmuring from Glaramara\'s inmost caves.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Virgin\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost    With the least shade of thought to sin allied.   Woman! above all women glorified,   Our tainted nature\'s solitary boast;   Purer than foam on central ocean tost;   Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn   With fancied roses, than the unblemished moon   Before her wane begins on heaven\'s blue coast;   Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,  Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,  As to a visible Power, in which did blend  All that was mixed and reconciled in thee  Of mother\'s love with maiden purity,  Of high with low, celestial with terrene!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAh!

Nor tongue no penReports of him, his dwelling or his grave!Does yet the unheard-of vessel ride the wave?Or is she swallowed up, remote from kenOf pitying human nature? Once againMethinks that we shall hail thee, Champion brave,Redeemed to baffle that imperial Slave,And through all Europe cheer desponding menWith new-born hope.

The chaise drove on; our journey\'s endWas nigh; and, sitting by my side,As if she had lost her only friendShe wept, nor would be pacified.Up to the tavern-door we post;Of Alice and her grief I told;And I gave money to the host,To buy a new cloak for the old.\'And let it be of duffil grey,As warm a cloak as man can sell!\' Proud creature was she the next day,The little orphan, Alice Fell!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nStepping Westward\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n"What, you are stepping westward?"--"Yea."---\'T would be a wildish destiny, If we, who thus together roam In a strange land, and far from home, Were in this place the guests of Chance: Yet who would stop, or fear to advance, Though home or shelter he had none, With such a sky to lead him on? The dewy ground was dark and cold; Behind, all gloomy to behold; And stepping westward seemed to be A kind of heavenly destiny: I liked the greeting; \'t was a sound Of something without place or bound; And seemed to give me spiritual right To travel through that region bright. The voice was soft, and she who spake Was walking by her native lake: The salutation had to me The very sound of courtesy: Its power was felt; and while my eye Was fixed upon the glowing sky, The echo of the voice enwrought A human sweetness with the thought Of travelling through the world that lay Before me in my endless way.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAdvance \\\'f1 Come Forth From Thy Tyrolean Ground\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nADVANCE-come forth from thy Tyrolean ground,Dear Liberty! stern Nymph of soul untamed;Sweet Nymph, O rightly of the mountains named!Through the long chain of Alps from mound to moundAnd o\'er the eternal snows, like Echo, bound;Like Echo, when the hunter train at dawnHave roused her from her sleep: and forest-lawn,Cliffs, woods and caves, her viewless steps resoundAnd babble of her pastime!-On, dread Power!With such invisible motion speed thy flight, Through hanging clouds, from craggy height to height,Through the green vales and through the herdsman\'s bower-That all the Alps may gladden in thy might,Here, there, and in all places at one hour.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nStanzas\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWITHIN our happy castle there dwelt OneWhom without blame I may not overlook;For never sun on living creature shoneWho more devout enjoyment with us took:Here on his hours he hung as on a book,On his own time here would he float away,As doth a fly upon a summer brook;But go tomorrow, or belike today,Seek for him,---he is fled; and whither none can say.Thus often would he leave our peaceful home,And find elsewhere his business or delight;Out of our Valley\'s limit did he roam:Full many a time, upon a stormy night,His voice came to us from the neighbouring height:Oft could we see him driving full in viewAt mid-day when the sun was shining bright;What ill was on him, what he had to do,A mighty wonder bred among our quiet crew.Ah! piteous sight it was to see this ManWhen he came back to us, a withered flower,---Or like a sinful creature, pale and wan.Down would he sit; and without strength or powerLook at the common grass from hour to hour:And oftentimes, how long I fear to say,Where apple-trees in blossom made a bower,Retired in that sunshiny shade he lay;And, like a naked Indian, slept himself away.Great wonder to our gentle tribe it wasWhenever from our Valley he withdrew;For happier soul no living creature hasThan he had, beiug here the long day through.Some thought he was a lover, and did woo:Some thought far worse of him, and judged him wrong;But verse was what he had been wedded to;And his own mind did like a tempest strongCome to him thus, and drove the weary Wight along.With him there often walked in friendly guise,Or lay upon the moss by brook or tree,A noticeable Man with large grey eyes,And a pale face that seemed undoubtedlyAs if a blooming face it ought to be;Heavy his low-hung lip did oft appear,Deprest by weight of musing Phantasy;Profound his forehead was, though not severe;Yet some did think that he had little business here:Sweet heaven forfend! his was a lawful right;Noisy he was, and gamesome as a boy;His limbs would toss about him with delightLike branches when strong winds the trees annoy.Nor lacked his calmer hours device or toyTo banish listlessness and irksome care;He would have taught you how you might employYourself; and many did to him repair,---And certes not in vain; he had inventions rare.Expedients, too, of simplest sort he tried:Long blades of grass, plucked round him as he lay,Made, to his ear attentively applied,A pipe on which the wind would deftly play;Glasses he had, that little things display,The beetle panoplied in gems and gold,A mailed angel on a battle-day;The mysteries that cups of flowers enfold,And all the gorgeous sights which fairies do behold.He would entice that other Man to hearHis music, and to view his imagery:And, sooth, these two were each to the other dear:No livelier love in such a place could be:There did they dwell\\\'97from earthly labour free,As happy spirits as were ever seen;If but a bird, to keep them company,Or butterfly sate down, they were, I ween,As pleased as if the same had been a Maiden-queen.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAddress To Kilchurn Castle, Upon Loch Awe\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCHILD of loud-throated War! the mountain StreamRoars in thy hearing; but thy hour of restIs come, and thou art silent in thy age;Save when the wind sweeps by and sounds are caughtAmbiguous, neither wholly thine nor theirs.Oh! there is life that breathes not; Powers there areThat touch each other to the quick in modesWhich the gross world no sense hath to perceive,No soul to dream of.

Not higher than a two years\' child It stands erect, this aged Thorn; No leaves it has, no prickly points; It is a mass of knotted joints, A wretched thing forlorn. It stands erect, and like a stone With lichens is it overgrown. II \'Like rock or stone, it is o\'ergrown, With lichens to the very top, And hung with heavy tufts of moss, A melancholy crop: Up from the earth these mosses creep, And this poor Thorn they clasp it round So close, you\'d say that they are bent With plain and manifest intent To drag it to the ground; And all have joined in one endeavour To bury this poor Thorn for ever. III \'High on a mountain\'s highest ridge, Where oft the stormy winter gale Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds It sweeps from vale to vale; Not five yards from the mountain path, This Thorn you on your left espy; And to the left, three yards beyond, You see a little muddy pond Of water--never dry Though but of compass small, and bare To thirsty suns and parching air. IV \'And, close beside this aged Thorn, There is a fresh and lovely sight, A beauteous heap, a hill of moss, Just half a foot in height. All lovely colours there you see, All colours that were ever seen; And mossy network too is there, As if by hand of lady fair The work had woven been; And cups, the darlings of the eye, So deep is their vermilion dye. V \'Ah me! what lovely tints are there Of olive green and scarlet bright, In spikes, in branches, and in stars, Green, red, and pearly white! This heap of earth o\'ergrown with moss, Which close beside the Thorn you see, So fresh in all its beauteous dyes, Is like an infant\'s grave in size, As like as like can be: But never, never any where, An infant\'s grave was half so fair. VI \'Now would you see this aged Thorn, This pond, and beauteous hill of moss, You must take care and choose your time The mountain when to cross. For oft there sits between the heap So like an infant\'s grave in size, And that same pond of which I spoke, A Woman in a scarlet cloak, And to herself she cries, \'Oh misery! oh misery! Oh woe is me! oh misery!\' VII \'At all times of the day and night This wretched Woman thither goes; And she is known to every star, And every wind that blows; And there, beside the Thorn, she sits When the blue daylight\'s in the skies, And when the whirlwind\'s on the hill, Or frosty air is keen and still, And to herself she cries, \'Oh misery! oh misery! Oh woe is me! oh misery!\'\' VIII \'Now wherefore, thus, by day and night, In rain, in tempest, and in snow, Thus to the dreary mountain-top Does this poor Woman go? And why sits she beside the Thorn When the blue daylight\'s in the sky Or when the whirlwind\'s on the hill, Or frosty air is keen and still, And wherefore does she cry?-- O wherefore? wherefore? tell me why Does she repeat that doleful cry?\' IX \'I cannot tell; I wish I could; For the true reason no one knows: But would you gladly view the spot, The spot to which she goes; The hillock like an infant\'s grave, The pond--and Thorn, so old and grey; Pass by her door--\'tis seldom shut-- And, if you see her in her hut-- Then to the spot away! I never heard of such as dare Approach the spot when she is there.\' X \'But wherefore to the mountain-top Can this unhappy Woman go? Whatever star is in the skies, Whatever wind may blow?\' \'Full twenty years are past and gone Since she (her name is Martha Ray) Gave with a maiden\'s true good-will Her company to Stephen Hill; And she was blithe and gay, While friends and kindred all approved Of him whom tenderly she loved. XI \'And they had fixed the wedding day, The morning that must wed them both; But Stephen to another Maid Had sworn another oath; And, with this other Maid, to church Unthinking Stephen went-- Poor Martha! on that woeful day A pang of pitiless dismay Into her soul was sent; A fire was kindled in her breast, Which might not burn itself to rest. XII \'They say, full six months after this, While yet the summer leaves were green, She to the mountain-top would go, And there was often seen. What could she seek?--or wish to hide? Her state to any eye was plain; She was with child, and she was mad; Yet often was she sober sad From her exceeding pain. O guilty Father--would that death Had saved him from that breach of faith! XIII Sad case for such a brain to hold Communion with a stirring child! Sad case, as you may think, for one Who had a brain so wild! Last Christmas-eve we talked of this, And grey-haired Wilfred of the glen Held that the unborn infant wrought About its mother\'s heart, and brought Her senses back again: And, when at last her time drew near, Her looks were calm, her senses clear. XIV \'More know I not, I wish I did, And it should all be told to you; For what became of this poor child No mortal ever knew; Nay--if a child to her was born No earthly tongue could ever tell; And if \'twas born alive or dead, Far less could this with proof be said; But some remember well, That Martha Ray about this time Would up the mountain often climb. XV \'And all that winter, when at night The wind blew from the mountain-peak, \'Twas worth your while, though in the dark, The churchyard path to seek: For many a time and oft were heard Cries coming from the mountain head: Some plainly living voices were; And others, I\'ve heard many swear, Were voices of the dead: I cannot think, whate\'er they say, They had to do with Martha Ray. XVI \'But that she goes to this old Thorn, The Thorn which I described to you, And there sits in a scarlet cloak I will be sworn is true. For one day with my telescope, To view the ocean wide and bright, When to this country first I came, Ere I had heard of Martha\'s name, I climbed the mountain\'s height:-- A storm came on, and I could see No object higher than my knee. XVII \'\'Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain: No screen, no fence could I discover; And then the wind! in sooth, it was A wind full ten times over. I looked around, I thought I saw A jutting crag,--and off I ran, Head-foremost, through the driving rain, The shelter of the crag to gain; And, as I am a man, Instead of jutting crag, I found A Woman seated on the ground. XVIII \'I did not speak--I saw her face; Her face!--it was enough for me; I turned about and heard her cry, \'Oh misery! oh misery!\' And there she sits, until the moon Through half the clear blue sky will go; And, when the little breezes make The waters of the pond to shake, As all the country know, She shudders, and you hear her cry, \'Oh misery! oh misery!\'\' XIX \'But what\'s the Thorn? and what the pond? And what the hill of moss to her? And what the creeping breeze that comes The little pond to stir?\' \'I cannot tell; but some will say She hanged her baby on the tree; Some say she drowned it in the pond, Which is a little step beyond: But all and each agree, The little Babe was buried there, Beneath that hill of moss so fair. XX \'I\'ve heard, the moss is spotted red With drops of that poor infant\'s blood; But kill a new-born infant thus, I do not think she could! Some say, if to the pond you go, And fix on it a steady view, The shadow of a babe you trace, A baby and a baby\'s face, And that it looks at you; Whene\'er you look on it, \'tis plain The baby looks at you again. XXI \'And some had sworn an oath that she Should be to public justice brought; And for the little infant\'s bones With spades they would have sought. But instantly the hill of moss Before their eyes began to stir! And, for full fifty yards around, The grass--it shook upon the ground! Yet all do still aver The little Babe lies buried there, Beneath that hill of moss so fair. XXII \'I cannot tell how this may be, But plain it is the Thorn is bound With heavy tufts of moss that strive To drag it to the ground; And this I know, full many a time, When she was on the mountain high, By day, and in the silent night, When all the stars shone clear and bright, That I have heard her cry, \'Oh misery! oh misery! Oh woe is me! oh misery!\'\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Prophecy.

Time was, blest Power! when youth and maids     At peep of dawn would rise,And wander forth, in forest glades     Thy birth to solemnize.Though mute the song---to grace the rite     Untouched the hawthorn bough,Thy Spirit triumphs o\'er the slight;     Man changes, but not Thou!Thy feathered Lieges bill and wings     In love\'s disport employ;Warmed by thy influence, creeping things     Awake to silent joy:Queen art thou still for each gay plant     Where the slim wild deer roves;And served in depths where fishes haunt     Their own mysterious groves.Cloud-piercing peak, and trackless heath,     Instinctive homage pay;Nor wants the dim-lit cave a wreath     To honor thee, sweet May!Where cities fanned by thy brisk airs     Behold a smokeless sky,Their puniest flower-pot-nursling dares     To open a bright eye.And if, on this thy natal morn,     The pole, from which thy nameHath not departed, stands forlorn     Of song and dance and game;Still from the village-green a vow     Aspires to thee addrest,Wherever peace is on the brow,     Or love within the breast.Yes! where Love nestles thou canst teach     The soul to love the more;Hearts also shall thy lessons reach     That never loved before.Stript is the haughty one of pride,     The bashful freed from fear,While rising, like the ocean-tide,     In flow the joyous year.Hush, feeble lyre! weak words refuse     The service to prolong!To yon exulting thrush the Muse     Entrusts the imperfect song;His voice shall chant, in accents clear,     Throughout the live-long day,Till the first silver star appear,     The sovereignty of May.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOn The Extinction Of The Venetian Republic\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nONCE did she hold the gorgeous East in fee; \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And was the safeguard of the West: the worth \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Of Venice did not fall below her birth, Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.

like a helpless child.My little joy! my little pride!In two day more I must have died.Then do not weep and grieve for me;I feel I must have died with thee.O wind, that o\'er my head art flyingThe way my friends their course did bend,I should not feel the pain of dying,Could I with thee a message end;Too soon, my friend, ye went away;For I had many thing to say.I\'ll follow you across the snow;Ye travel heavily and slow;In spite of all my weary painI\'ll look upon your tent again.---My fire is dead, and snowy whiteThe water which beside it stood:The wolf has come to me to-night,And he has stolen away my food.Forever left alone am I;Then wherefore should I fear to die ?Young as I am, my course is run,I shall not see another sun;I cannot lift my limb to knowIf they have any life or no.My poor forsaken child, if IFor once could have thee close to me,With happy heart I then would die,And my last thought would happy be;But thou, dear Babe, art far away,Nor shall I see another day.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere Was A Boy\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs And islands of Winander!--many a time, At evening, when the earliest stars began To move along the edges of the hills, Rising or setting, would he stand alone, Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake; And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls, That they might answer him.--And they would shout Across the watery vale, and shout again, Responsive to his call,--with quivering peals, And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause Of silence such as baffled his best skill: Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received Into the bosom of the steady lake. This boy was taken from his mates, and died In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs Upon a slope above the village-school; And, through that church-yard when my way has led On summer-evenings, I believe, that there A long half-hour together I have stood Mute--looking at the grave in which he lies!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOn The Departure Of Sir Walter Scott From Abbotsford\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain,    Nor of the setting sun\'s pathetic light   Engendered, hangs o\'er Eildon\'s triple height:   Spirits of Power, assembled there, complain   For kindred Power departing from their sight;   While Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain,   Saddens his voice again, and yet again.

Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees A mountain ascending, a vision of trees; Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide, And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside. Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale, Down which she so often has tripped with her pail; And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove\'s, The one only dwelling on earth that she loves. She looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade, The mist and the river, the hill and the shade: The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise, And the colours have all passed away from her eyes!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Sun Has Long Been Set\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe sun has long been set,The stars are out by twos and threes,The little birds are piping yetAmong the bushes and the trees;There\'s a cuckoo, and one or two thrushes,And a far-off wind that rushes,And a sound of water that gushes,And the cuckoo\'s sovereign cryFills all the hollow of the sky.Who would go `parading\'In London, `and masquerading\',On such a night of JuneWith that beautiful soft half-moon,And all these innocent blisses?On such a night as this is!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOctober, 1803\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.  These times strike monied worldlings with dismay:   Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air   With words of apprehension and despair:   While tens of thousands, thinking on the affray,   Men unto whom sufficient for the day   And minds not stinted or untilled are given,   Sound, healthy, children of the God of heaven,   Are cheerful as the rising sun in May.   What do we gather hence but firmer faith  That every gift of noble origin  Is breathed upon by Hope\'s perpetual breath;  That virtue and the faculties within  Are vital,--and that riches are akin  To fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWritten In Germany, On One Of The Coldest Days Of The Century\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA plague on your languages, German and Norse! Let me have the song of the kettle; And the tongs and the poker, instead of that horse That gallops away with such fury and force On this dreary dull plate of black metal. See that Fly,--a disconsolate creature! perhaps A child of the field or the grove; And, sorrow for him! the dull treacherous heat Has seduced the poor fool from his winter retreat, And he creeps to the edge of my stove. Alas! how he fumbles about the domains Which this comfortless oven environ! He cannot find out in what track he must crawl, Now back to the tiles, then in search of the wall, And now on the brink of the iron. Stock-still there he stands like a traveller bemazed: The best of his skill he has tried; His feelers, methinks, I can see him put forth To the east and the west, to the south and the north; But he finds neither guide-post nor guide. His spindles sink under him, foot, leg, and thigh! His eyesight and hearing are lost; Between life and death his blood freezes and thaws; And his two pretty pinions of blue dusky gauze Are glued to his sides by the frost. No brother, no mate has he near him--while I Can draw warmth from the cheek of my Love; As blest and as glad, in this desolate gloom, As if green summer grass were the floor of my room, And woodbines were hanging above. Yet, God is my witness, thou small helpless Thing! Thy life I would gladly sustain Till summer come up from the south, and with crowds Of thy brethren a march thou should\'st sound through the clouds, And back to the forests again!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nInside Of King\'s College Chapel, Cambridge\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,    With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned--   Albeit labouring for a scanty band   Of white-robed Scholars only--this immense   And glorious Work of fine intelligence!   Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the lore   Of nicely-calculated less or more;   So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense   These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof  Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,  Where light and shade repose, where music dwells  Lingering--and wandering on as loth to die;  Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof  That they were born for immortality.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nInscriptions Written With A Slate Pencil Upon A Stone\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE LARGEST OF A HEAP LYING NEAR A DESERTED QUARRY, UPON ONE OF THE ISLANDS AT RYDAL Stranger! this hillock of mis-shapen stones Is not a Ruin spared or made by time, Nor, as perchance thou rashly deem\'st, the Cairn Of some old British Chief: \'tis nothing more Than the rude embryo of a little Dome Or Pleasure-house, once destined to be built Among the birch-trees of this rocky isle. But, as it chanced, Sir William having learned That from the shore a full-grown man might wade, And make himself a freeman of this spot At any hour he chose, the prudent Knight Desisted, and the quarry and the mound Are monuments of his unfinished task. The block on which these lines are traced, perhaps, Was once selected as the corner-stone Of that intended Pile, which would have been Some quaint odd plaything of elaborate skill, So that, I guess, the linnet and the thrush, And other little builders who dwell here, Had wondered at the work. But blame him not, For old Sir William was a gentle Knight, Bled in this vale, to which he appertained With all his ancestry. Then peace to him, And for the outrage which he had devised Entire forgiveness!--But if thou art one On fire with thy impatience to become An inmate of these mountains,--if, disturbed By beautiful conceptions, thou hast hewn Out of the quiet rock the elements Of thy trim Mansion destined soon to blaze In snow-white splendour,--think again; and, taught By old Sir William and his quarry, leave Thy fragments to the bramble and the rose; There let the vernal slow-worm sun himself, And let the redbreast hop from stone to stone.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAdmonition\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWELL may\'st thou halt-and gaze with brightening eye!The lovely Cottage in the guardian nookHath stirred thee deeply; with its own dear brook,Its own small pasture, almost its own sky!But covet not the Abode;-forbear to sigh,As many do, repining while they look;Intruders-who would tear from Nature\'s bookThis precious leaf, with harsh impiety.Think what the home must be if it were thine,Even thine, though few thy wants!-Roof, window, door, The very flowers are sacred to the Poor,The roses to the porch which they entwine:Yea, all, that now enchants thee, from the dayOn which it should be touched, would melt away.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEngland Iii\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nGREAT men have been among us; hands that penn\'d \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And tongues that utter\'d wisdom--better none: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The later Sidney, Marvel, Harrington, Young Vane, and others who call\'d Milton friend.

The aged Man Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone That overlays the pile; and, from a bag All white with flour, the dole of village dames, He drew his scraps and fragments, one by one; And scanned them with a fixed and serious look Of idle computation. In the sun, Upon the second step of that small pile, Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills, He sat, and ate his food in solitude: And ever, scattered from his palsied hand, That, still attempting to prevent the waste, Was baffled still, the crumbs in little showers Fell on the ground; and the small mountain birds, Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal, Approached within the length of half his staff. Him from my childhood have I known; and then He was so old, he seems not older now; He travels on, a solitary Man, So helpless in appearance, that for him The sauntering Horseman throws not with a slack And careless hand his alms upon the ground, But stops,--that he may safely lodge the coin Within the old Man\'s hat; nor quits him so, But still, when he has given his horse the rein, Watches the aged Beggar with a look Sidelong, and half-reverted. She who tends The toll-gate, when in summer at her door She turns her wheel, if on the road she sees The aged beggar coming, quits her work, And lifts the latch for him that he may pass. The post-boy, when his rattling wheels o\'ertake The aged Beggar in the woody lane, Shouts to him from behind; and if, thus warned, The old man does not change his course, the boy Turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside, And passes gently by, without a curse Upon his lips, or anger at his heart. He travels on, a solitary Man; His age has no companion. On the ground His eyes are turned, and, as he moves along \'They\' move along the ground; and, evermore, Instead of common and habitual sight Of fields with rural works, of hill and dale, And the blue sky, one little span of earth Is all his prospect. Thus, from day to day, Bow-bent, his eyes for ever on the ground, He plies his weary journey; seeing still, And seldom knowing that he sees, some straw, Some scattered leaf, or marks which, in one track, The nails of cart or chariot-wheel have left Impressed on the white road,--in the same line, At distance still the same. Poor Traveller! His staff trails with him; scarcely do his feet Disturb the summer dust; he is so still In look and motion, that the cottage curs, Ere he has passed the door, will turn away, Weary of barking at him. Boys and girls, The vacant and the busy, maids and youths, And urchins newly breeched--all pass him by: Him even the slow-paced waggon leaves behind. But deem not this Man useless.--Statesmen! ye Who are so restless in your wisdom, ye Who have a broom still ready in your hands To rid the world of nuisances; ye proud, Heart-swoln, while in your pride ye contemplate Your talents, power, or wisdom, deem him not A burthen of the earth! \'Tis Nature\'s law That none, the meanest of created things, Or forms created the most vile and brute, The dullest or most noxious, should exist Divorced from good--a spirit and pulse of good, A life and soul, to every mode of being Inseparably linked. Then be assured That least of all can aught--that ever owned The heaven-regarding eye and front sublime Which man is born to--sink, howe\'er depressed, So low as to be scorned without a sin; Without offence to God cast out of view; Like the dry remnant of a garden-flower Whose seeds are shed, or as an implement Worn out and worthless. While from door to door, This old Man creeps, the villagers in him Behold a record which together binds Past deeds and offices of charity, Else unremembered, and so keeps alive The kindly mood in hearts which lapse of years, And that half-wisdom half-experience gives, Make slow to feel, and by sure steps resign To selfishness and cold oblivious cares. Among the farms and solitary huts, Hamlets and thinly-scattered villages, Where\'er the aged Beggar takes his rounds, The mild necessity of use compels To acts of love; and habit does the work 0 Of reason; yet prepares that after-joy Which reason cherishes. And thus the soul, By that sweet taste of pleasure unpursued, Doth find herself insensibly disposed To virtue and true goodness. Some there are, By their good works exalted, lofty minds And meditative, authors of delight And happiness, which to the end of time Will live, and spread, and kindle: even such minds In childhood, from this solitary Being, Or from like wanderer, haply have received (A thing more precious far than all that books Or the solicitudes of love can do!) That first mild touch of sympathy and thought, In which they found their kindred with a world Where want and sorrow were. The easy man Who sits at his own door,--and, like the pear That overhangs his head from the green wall, Feeds in the sunshine; the robust and young, The prosperous and unthinking, they who live Sheltered, and flourish in a little grove Of their own kindred;--all behold in him A silent monitor, which on their minds Must needs impress a transitory thought Of self-congratulation, to the heart Of each recalling his peculiar boons, His charters and exemptions; and, perchance, Though he to no one give the fortitude And circumspection needful to preserve His present blessings, and to husband up The respite of the season, he, at least, And \'tis no vulgar service, makes them felt. Yet further.----Many, I believe, there are Who live a life of virtuous decency, Men who can hear the Decalogue and feel No self-reproach; who of the moral law Established in the land where they abide Are strict observers; and not negligent In acts of love to those with whom they dwell, Their kindred, and the children of their blood. Praise be to such, and to their slumbers peace! --But of the poor man ask, the abject poor; Go, and demand of him, if there be here In this cold abstinence from evil deeds, And these inevitable charities, Wherewith to satisfy the human soul? No--man is dear to man; the poorest poor Long for some moments in a weary life When they can know and feel that they have been, Themselves, the fathers and the dealers-out Of some small blessings; have been kind to such As needed kindness, for this single cause, That we have all of us one human heart. --Such pleasure is to one kind Being known, My neighbour, when with punctual care, each week Duly as Friday comes, though pressed herself By her own wants, she from her store of meal Takes one unsparing handful for the scrip Of this old Mendicant, and, from her door Returning with exhilarated heart, Sits by her fire, and builds her hope in heaven. Then let him pass, a blessing on his head! And while in that vast solitude to which The tide of things has borne him, he appears To breathe and live but for himself alone, Unblamed, uninjured, let him bear about The good which the benignant law of Heaven Has hung around him: and, while life is his, Still let him prompt the unlettered villagers To tender offices and pensive thoughts. --Then let him pass, a blessing on his head! And, long as he can wander, let him breathe The freshness of the valleys; let his blood Struggle with frosty air and winter snows; And let the chartered wind that sweeps the heath Beat his grey locks against his withered face. Reverence the hope whose vital anxiousness Gives the last human interest to his heart. May never HOUSE, misnamed of INDUSTRY, Make him a captive!--for that pent-up din, Those life-consuming sounds that clog the air, Be his the natural silence of old age! Let him be free of mountain solitudes; And have around him, whether heard or not, The pleasant melody of woodland birds. Few are his pleasures: if his eyes have now Been doomed so long to settle upon earth That not without some effort they behold The countenance of the horizontal sun, Rising or setting, let the light at least Find a free entrance to their languid orbs. And let him, \'where\' and \'when\' he will, sit down Beneath the trees, or on a grassy bank Of highway side, and with the little birds Share his chance-gathered meal; and, finally, As in the eye of Nature he has lived, So in the eye of Nature let him die!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYarrow Revisited\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n. The gallant Youth, who may have gained,    Or seeks, a "winsome Marrow,"  Was but an Infant in the lap    When first I looked on Yarrow;  Once more, by Newark\'s Castle-gate    Long left without a warder,  I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee,    Great Minstrel of the Border!  Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,   Their dignity installing In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves   Were on the bough, or falling; But breezes played, and sunshine gleamed-   The forest to embolden; Reddened the fiery hues, and shot   Transparence through the golden. For busy thoughts the Stream flowed on   In foamy agitation; And slept in many a crystal pool   For quiet contemplation: No public and no private care   The freeborn mind enthralling, We made a day of happy hours,   Our happy days recalling. Brisk Youth appeared, the Morn of youth,   With freaks of graceful folly,- Life\'s temperate Noon, her sober Eve,   Her Night not melancholy; Past, present, future, all appeared   In harmony united, Like guests that meet, and some from far,   By cordial love invited. And if, as Yarrow, through the woods   And down the meadow ranging, Did meet us with unaltered face,   Though we were changed and changing; If, then, some natural shadows spread   Our inward prospect over, The soul\'s deep valley was not slow   Its brightness to recover. Eternal blessings on the Muse,   And her divine employment! The blameless Muse, who trains her Sons   For hope and calm enjoyment; Albeit sickness, lingering yet,   Has o\'er their pillow brooded; And Care waylays their steps-a Sprite   Not easily eluded. For thee, O Scott! compelled to change   Green Eildon-hill and Cheviot For warm Vesuvio\'s vine-clad slopes;   And leave thy Tweed and Tiviot For mild Sorrento\'s breezy waves;   May classic Fancy, linking With native Fancy her fresh aid,   Preserve thy heart from sinking! Oh! while they minister to thee,   Each vying with the other, May Health return to mellow Age   With Strength, her venturous brother; And Tiber, and each brook and rill   Renowned in song and story, With unimagined beauty shine,   Nor lose one ray of glory! For Thou, upon a hundred streams,   By tales of love and sorrow, Of faithful love, undaunted truth   Hast shed the power of Yarrow; And streams unknown, hills yet unseen,   Wherever they invite Thee, At parent Nature\'s grateful call,   With gladness must requite Thee. A gracious welcome shall be thine,   Such looks of love and honour As thy own Yarrow gave to me   When first I gazed upon her; Beheld what I had feared to see,   Unwilling to surrender Dreams treasured up from early days,   The holy and the tender. And what, for this frail world, were all   That mortals do or suffer, Did no responsive harp, no pen,   Memorial tribute offer? Yea, what were mighty Nature\'s self?   Her features, could they win us, Unhelped by the poetic voice   That hourly speaks within us? Nor deem that localized Romance   Plays false with our affections; Unsanctifies our tears-made sport   For fanciful dejections: Ah, no! the visions of the past   Sustain the heart in feeling Life as she is-our changeful Life,   With friends and kindred dealing. Bear witness, Ye, whose thoughts that day   In Yarrow\'s groves were centred; Who through the silent portal arch   Of mouldering Newark entered; And clomb the winding stair that once   Too timidly was mounted By the "last Minstrel,"(not the last!)   Ere he his Tale recounted. Flow on for ever, Yarrow Stream!   Fulfil thy pensive duty, Well pleased that future Bards should chant   For simple hearts thy beauty; To dream-light dear while yet unseen,   Dear to the common sunshine, And dearer still, as now I feel,   To memory\'s shadowy moonshine!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI Know An Old Man Constrained To Dwell\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI know an aged Man constrained to dwell In a large house of public charity, Where he abides, as in a Prisoner\'s cell, With numbers near, alas! no company. When he could creep about, at will, though poor And forced to live on alms, this old Man fed A Redbreast, one that to his cottage door Came not, but in a lane partook his bread. There, at the root of one particular tree, An easy seat this worn-out Labourer found While Robin pecked the crumbs upon his knee Laid one by one, or scattered on the ground. Dear intercourse was theirs, day after day; What signs of mutual gladness when they met! Think of their common peace, their simple play, The parting moment and its fond regret. Months passed in love that failed not to fulfil, In spite of season\'s change, its own demand, By fluttering pinions here and busy bill; There by caresses from a tremulous hand. Thus in the chosen spot a tie so strong Was formed between the solitary pair, That when his fate had housed him \'mid a throng The Captive shunned all converse proffered there. Wife, children, kindred, they were dead and gone; But, if no evil hap his wishes crossed, One living Stay was left, and on that one Some recompence for all that he had lost. Oh that the good old Man had power to prove, By message sent through air or visible token, That still he loves the Bird, and still must love; That friendship lasts though fellowship is broken!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSimon Lee: The Old Huntsman\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.  With an incident in which he was concerned    In the sweet shire of Cardigan,    Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,   An old Man dwells, a little man,--   \'Tis said he once was tall.   For five-and-thirty years he lived   A running huntsman merry;   And still the centre of his cheek   Is red as a ripe cherry.   No man like him the horn could sound,  And hill and valley rang with glee  When Echo bandied, round and round  The halloo of Simon Lee.  In those proud days, he little cared  For husbandry or tillage;  To blither tasks did Simon rouse  The sleepers of the village.  He all the country could outrun,  Could leave both man and horse behind;  And often, ere the chase was done,  He reeled, and was stone-blind.  And still there\'s something in the world  At which his heart rejoices;  For when the chiming hounds are out,  He dearly loves their voices!  But, oh the heavy change!--bereft  Of health, strength, friends, and kindred, see!  Old Simon to the world is left  In liveried poverty.  His Master\'s dead--and no one now  Dwells in the Hall of Ivor;  Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;  He is the sole survivor.  And he is lean and he is sick;  His body, dwindled and awry,  Rests upon ankles swoln and thick;  His legs are thin and dry.  One prop he has, and only one,  His wife, an aged woman,  Lives with him, near the waterfall,  Upon the village Common.  Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,  Not twenty paces from the door,  A scrap of land they have, but they  Are poorest of the poor.  This scrap of land he from the heath  Enclosed when he was stronger;  But what to them avails the land  Which he can till no longer?  Oft, working by her Husband\'s side,  Ruth does what Simon cannot do;  For she, with scanty cause for pride,  Is stouter of the two.  And, though you with your utmost skill  From labour could not wean them,  \'Tis little, very little--all  That they can do between them.  Few months of life has he in store  As he to you will tell,  For still, the more he works, the more   Do his weak ankles swell.  My gentle Reader, I perceive,  How patiently you\'ve waited,  And now I fear that you expect  Some tale will be related.  O Reader! had you in your mind  Such stores as silent thought can bring,  O gentle Reader! you would find  A tale in every thing.  What more I have to say is short,  And you must kindly take it:  It is no tale; but, should you think,  Perhaps a tale you\'ll make it.  One summer-day I chanced to see  This old Man doing all he could  To unearth the root of an old tree,  A stump of rotten wood.  The mattock tottered in his hand;  So vain was his endeavour,  That at the root of the old tree  He might have worked for ever.  "You\'re overtasked, good Simon Lee,  Give me your tool," to him I said;  And at the word right gladly he  Received my proffered aid.  I struck, and with a single blow  The tangled root I severed,  At which the poor old Man so long  And vainly had endeavoured.  The tears into his eyes were brought,  And thanks and praises seemed to run  So fast out of his heart, I thought  They never would have done.  --I\'ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds  With coldness still returning;  Alas! the gratitude of men  Hath oftener left me mourning.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEngland I\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nO FRIEND!

Rapine, avarice, expense, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86This is idolatry; and these we adore: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Plain living and high thinking are no more: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The homely beauty of the good old cause Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And pure religion breathing household laws.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nRural Architecture\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere\'s George Fisher, Charles Fleming, and Reginald Shore, Three rosy-cheeked school-boys, the highest not more Than the height of a counsellor\'s bag; To the top of GREAT HOW did it please them to climb: And there they built up, without mortar or lime, A Man on the peak of the crag. They built him of stones gathered up as they lay: They built him and christened him all in one day, An urchin both vigorous and hale; And so without scruple they called him Ralph Jones. Now Ralph is renowned for the length of his bones; The Magog of Legberthwaite dale. Just half a week after, the wind sallied forth, And, in anger or merriment, out of the north, Coming on with a terrible pother, From the peak of the crag blew the giant away. And what did these school-boys?--The very next day They went and they built up another. --Some little I\'ve seen of blind boisterous works By Christian disturbers more savage than Turks, Spirits busy to do and undo: At remembrance whereof my blood sometimes will flag; Then, light-hearted Boys, to the top of the crag! And I\'ll build up giant with you.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAddress To My Infant Daughter, Dora On Being Reminded That She Was A Month Old That Day, September 1\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n--HAST thou then survived-Mild Offspring of infirm humanity,Meek Infant! among all forlornest thingsThe most forlorn-one life of that bright star,The second glory of the Heavens?-Thou hast,Already hast survived that great decay,That transformation through the wide earth felt,And by all nations. In that Being\'s sightFrom whom the Race of human kind proceed,A thousand years are but as yesterday; And one day\'s narrow circuit is to HimNot less capacious than a thousand years.But what is time? What outward glory? neitherA measure is of Thee, whose claims extendThrough \'heaven\'s eternal year.\'-Yet hail to Thee,Frail, feeble Monthling!-by that name, methinks,Thy scanty breathing-time is portioned outNot idly.-Hadst thou been of Indian birth,Couched on a casual bed of moss and leaves,And rudely canopied by leafy boughs, Or to the churlish elements exposedOn the blank plains,-the coldness of the night,Or the night\'s darkness, or its cheerful faceOf beauty, by the changing moon adorned,Would, with imperious admonition, thenHave scored thine age, and punctually timedThine infant history, on the minds of thoseWho might have wandered with thee.-Mother\'s love,Nor less than mother\'s love in other breasts,Will, among us warm-clad and warmly housed, Do for thee what the finger of the heavensDoth all too often harshly executeFor thy unblest coevals, amid wildsWhere fancy hath small liberty to graceThe affections, to exalt them or refine;And the maternal sympathy itself,Though strong, is, in the main, a joyless tieOf naked instinct, wound about the heart.Happier, far happier is thy lot and ours!Even now-to solemnise thy helpless state, And to enliven in the mind\'s regardThy passive beauty-parallels have risen,Resemblances, or contrasts, that connect,Within the region of a father\'s thoughts,Thee and thy mate and sister of the sky.And first;-thy sinless progress, through a worldBy sorrow darkened and by care disturbed,Apt likeness bears to hers, through gathered clouds,Moving untouched in silver purity,And cheering oft-times their reluctant gloom. Fair are ye both, and both are free from stain:But thou, how leisurely thou fill\'st thy hornWith brightness! leaving her to post along,And range about, disquieted in change,And still impatient of the shape she wears.Once up, once down the hill, one journey, BabeThat will suffice thee; and it seems that nowThou hast fore-knowledge that such task is thine;Thou travellest so contentedly, and sleep\'stIn such a heedless peace. Alas! full soon Hath this conception, grateful to behold,Changed countenance, like an object sullied o\'erBy breathing mist; and thine appears to beA mournful labour, while to her is givenHope, and a renovation without end.-That smile forbids the thought; for on thy faceSmiles are beginning, like the beams of dawn,To shoot and circulate; smiles have there been seenTranquil assurances that Heaven supportsThe feeble motions of thy life, and cheers Thy loneliness: or shall those smiles be calledFeelers of love, put forth as if to exploreThis untried world, and to prepare thy wayThrough a strait passage intricate and dim?Such are they; and the same are tokens, signs,Which, when the appointed season hath arrived,Joy, as her holiest language, shall adopt;And Reason\'s godlike Power be proud to own.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWith Ships The Sea Was Sprinkled\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWITH ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh, Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed; Some lying fast at anchor in the road, Some veering up and down, one knew not why. A goodly vessel did I then espy Come like a giant from a haven broad; And lustily along the bay she strode, Her tackling rich, and of apparel high. The ship was nought to me, nor I to her, Yet I pursued her with a lover\'s look; This ship to all the rest did I prefer: When will she turn, and whither? She will brook No tarrying; where she comes the winds must stir: On went she, and due north her journey took.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOak And The Broom, The: A Pastoral Poem\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI His simple truths did Andrew glean Beside the babbling rills; A careful student he had been Among the woods and hills. One winter\'s night, when through the trees The wind was roaring, on his knees His youngest born did Andrew hold: And while the rest, a ruddy quire, Were seated round their blazing fire, This Tale the Shepherd told. II "I saw a crag, a lofty stone As ever tempest beat! Out of its head an Oak had grown, A Broom out of its feet. The time was March, a cheerful noon-- The thaw-wind, with the breath of June, Breathed gently from the warm south-west: When, in a voice sedate with age, This Oak, a giant and a sage, His neighbour thus addressed:-- III "\'Eight weary weeks, through rock and clay, Along this mountain\'s edge, The Frost hath wrought both night and day, Wedge driving after wedge. Look up! and think, above your head What trouble, surely, will be bred; Last night I heard a crash--\'tis true, The splinters took another road-- I see them yonder--what a load For such a Thing as you! IV "\'You are preparing as before, To deck your slender shape; And yet, just three years back--no more-- You had a strange escape: Down from yon cliff a fragment broke; It thundered down, with fire and smoke, And hitherward pursued its way; This ponderous block was caught by me, And o\'er your head, as you may see, \'Tis hanging to this day! V "\'If breeze or bird to this rough steep Your kind\'s first seed did bear; The breeze had better been asleep, The bird caught in a snare: For you and your green twigs decoy The little witless shepherd-boy To come and slumber in your bower; And, trust me, on some sultry noon, Both you and he, Heaven knows how soon! Will perish in one hour. VI "\'From me this friendly warning take\'-- The Broom began to doze, And thus, to keep herself awake, Did gently interpose: \'My thanks for your discourse are due; That more than what you say is true, I know, and I have known it long; Frail is the bond by which we hold Our being, whether young or old, Wise, foolish, weak, or strong. VII "\'Disasters, do the best we can, Will reach both great and small; And he is oft the wisest man, Who is not wise at all. For me, why should I wish to roam? This spot is my paternal home, It is my pleasant heritage; My father many a happy year, Spread here his careless blossoms, here Attained a good old age. VIII "\'Even such as his may be my lot. What cause have I to haunt My heart with terrors? Am I not In truth a favoured plant! On me such bounty Summer pours, That I am covered o\'er with flowers; And, when the Frost is in the sky, My branches are so fresh and gay That you might look at me and say, This Plant can never die. IX "\'The butterfly, all green and gold, To me hath often flown, Here in my blossoms to behold Wings lovely as his own. When grass is chill with rain or dew, Beneath my shade, the mother-ewe Lies with her infant lamb; I see The love they to each other make, And the sweet joy which they partake, It is a joy to me.\' X "Her voice was blithe, her heart was light; The Broom might have pursued Her speech, until the stars of night Their journey had renewed; But in the branches of the oak Two ravens now began to croak Their nuptial song, a gladsome air; And to her own green bower the breeze That instant brought two stripling bees To rest, or murmur there. XI "One night, my Children! from the north There came a furious blast; At break of day I ventured forth, And near the cliff I passed. The storm had fallen upon the Oak, And struck him with a mighty stroke, And whirled, and whirled him far away; And, in one hospitable cleft, The little careless Broom was left To live for many a day."\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLucy\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI.STRANGE fits of passion have I known:And I will dare to tell,But in the lover\'s ear alone,What once to me befell. When she I loved look\'d every dayFresh as a rose in June,I to her cottage bent my way,Beneath an evening moon. Upon the moon I fix\'d my eye,All over the wide lea; With quickening pace my horse drew nighThose paths so dear to me. And now we reach\'d the orchard-plot; And, as we climb\'d the hill,The sinking moon to Lucy\'s cotCame near and nearer still. In one of those sweet dreams I slept,Kind Nature\'s gentlest boon! And all the while my eyes I keptOn the descending moon. My horse moved on; hoof after hoofHe raised, and never stopp\'d:When down behind the cottage roof,At once, the bright moon dropp\'d. What fond and wayward thoughts will slideInto a lover\'s head! \'O mercy! \' to myself I cried,\'If Lucy should be dead! \' II. HE dwelt among the untrodden waysBeside the springs of Dove,A Maid whom there were none to praiseAnd very few to love: A violet by a mossy stoneHalf hidden from the eye! Fair as a star, when only oneIs shining in the sky. She lived unknown, and few could knowWhen Lucy ceased to be; But she is in her grave, and oh,The difference to me!  III.  TRAVELL\'D among unknown men,In lands beyond the sea; Nor, England! did I know till thenWhat love I bore to thee. \'Tis past, that melancholy dream! Nor will I quit thy shoreA second time; for still I seemTo love thee more and more. Among the mountains did I feelThe joy of my desire; And she I cherish\'d turn\'d her wheelBeside an English fire. Thy mornings show\'d, thy nights conceal\'d,The bowers where Lucy play\'d; And thine too is the last green fieldThat Lucy\'s eyes survey\'d. IV. HREE years she grew in sun and shower; Then Nature said, \'A lovelier flowerOn earth was never sown; This child I to myself will take; She shall be mine, and I will makeA lady of my own. \'Myself will to my darling beBoth law and impulse; and with meThe girl, in rock and plain,In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,Shall feel an overseeing powerTo kindle or restrain. \'She shall be sportive as the fawnThat wild with glee across the lawnOr up the mountain springs; And hers shall be the breathing balm,And hers the silence and the calmOf mute insensate things. \'The floating clouds their state shall lendTo her; for her the willow bend; Nor shall she fail to seeEven in the motions of the stormGrace that shall mould the maiden\'s formBy silent sympathy. \'The stars of midnight shall be dearTo her; and she shall lean her earIn many a secret placeWhere rivulets dance their wayward round,And beauty born of murmuring soundShall pass into her face. \'And vital feelings of delightShall rear her form to stately height,Her virgin bosom swell; Such thoughts to Lucy I will giveWhile she and I together liveHere in this happy dell.\' Thus Nature spake -  The work was done - How soon my Lucy\'s race was run! She died, and left to meThis heath, this calm and quiet scene; The memory of what has been,And never more will be. V.  SLUMBER did my spirit seal; I had no human fears:She seem\'d a thing that could not feelThe touch of earthly years. No motion has she now, no force; She neither hears nor sees; Roll\'d round in earth\'s diurnal course,With rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNovember, 1806\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   Another year!--another deadly blow!    Another mighty Empire overthrown!   And We are left, or shall be left, alone;   The last that dare to struggle with the Foe.   \'Tis well! from this day forward we shall know   That in ourselves our safety must be sought;   That by our own right hands it must be wrought;   That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.   O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!  We shall exult, if they who rule the land  Be men who hold its many blessings dear,  Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,  Who are to judge of danger which they fear,  And honour which they do not understand.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWith How Sad Steps, O Moon, Thou Climb\'st The Sky\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWith how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb\'st the sky,"How silently, and with how wan a face!"Where art thou? Thou so often seen on highRunning among the clouds a Wood-nymph\'s race!Unhappy Nuns, whose common breath\'s a sighWhich they would stifle, move at such a pace!The northern Wind, to call thee to the chase,Must blow to-night his bugle horn. Had IThe power of Merlin, Goddess! this should be:And all the stars, fast as the clouds were riven, Should sally forth, to keep thee company,Hurrying and sparkling through the clear blue heaven.But, Cynthia! should to thee the palm be given,Queen both for beauty and for majesty.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nHart-Leap Well\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Knight had ridden down from Wensley Moor With the slow motion of a summer\'s cloud, And now, as he approached a vassal\'s door, "Bring forth another horse!" he cried aloud. "Another horse!"--That shout the vassal heard And saddled his best Steed, a comely grey; Sir Walter mounted him; he was the third Which he had mounted on that glorious day. Joy sparkled in the prancing courser\'s eyes; The horse and horseman are a happy pair; But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies, There is a doleful silence in the air. A rout this morning left Sir Walter\'s Hall, That as they galloped made the echoes roar; But horse and man are vanished, one and all; Such race, I think, was never seen before. Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind, Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain: Blanch, Swift, and Music, noblest of their kind, Follow, and up the weary mountain strain. The Knight hallooed, he cheered and chid them on With suppliant gestures and upbraidings stern; But breath and eyesight fail; and, one by one, The dogs are stretched among the mountain fern. Where is the throng, the tumult of the race? The bugles that so joyfully were blown? --This chase it looks not like an earthly chase; Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone. The poor Hart toils along the mountainside; I will not stop to tell how far he fled, Nor will I mention by what death he died; But now the Knight beholds him lying dead. Dismounting, then, he leaned against a thorn; He had no follower, dog, nor man, nor boy: He neither cracked his whip, nor blew his horn, But gazed upon the spoil with silent joy. Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter leaned, Stood his dumb partner in this glorious feat; Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned; And white with foam as if with cleaving sleet. Upon his side the Hart was lying stretched: His nostril touched a spring beneath a hill, And with the last deep groan his breath had fetched The waters of the spring were trembling still. And now, too happy for repose or rest, (Never had living man such joyful lot!) Sir Walter walked all round, north, south, and west, And gazed and gazed upon that darling spot. And climbing up the hill--(it was at least Four roods of sheer ascent) Sir Walter found Three several hoof-marks which the hunted Beast Had left imprinted on the grassy ground. Sir Walter wiped his face, and cried, "Till now Such sight was never seen by human eyes: Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow, Down to the very fountain where he lies. "I\'ll build a pleasure-house upon this spot, And a small arbour, made for rural joy; \'Twill be the traveller\'s shed, the pilgrim\'s cot, A place of love for damsels that are coy. "A cunning artist will I have to frame A basin for that fountain in the dell! And they who do make mention of the same, From this day forth, shall call it HART-LEAP WELL. "And, gallant Stag! to make thy praises known, Another monument shall here be raised; Three several pillars, each a rough-hewn stone, And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed. "And, in the summer-time when days are long, I will come hither with my Paramour; And with the dancers and the minstrel\'s song We will make merry in that pleasant bower. "Till the foundations of the mountains fail My mansion with its arbour shall endure;-- The joy of them who till the fields of Swale, And them who dwell among the woods of Ure!" Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone-dead, With breathless nostrils stretched above the spring. --Soon did the Knight perform what he had said; And far and wide the fame thereof did ring. Ere thrice the Moon into her port had steered, A cup of stone received the living well; Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter reared, And built a house of pleasure in the dell. And near the fountain, flowers of stature tall With trailing plants and trees were intertwined,-- Which soon composed a little sylvan hall, A leafy shelter from the sun and wind. And thither, when the summer days were long, Sir Walter led his wondering Paramour; And with the dancers and the minstrel\'s song Made merriment within that pleasant bower. The Knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time, And his bones lie in his paternal vale.-- But there is matter for a second rhyme, And I to this would add another tale. PART SECOND THE moving accident is not my trade; To freeze the blood I have no ready arts: \'Tis my delight, alone in summer shade, To pipe a simple song for thinking hearts. 0 As I from Hawes to Richmond did repair, It chanced that I saw standing in a dell Three aspens at three corners of a square; And one, not four yards distant, near a well. What this imported I could ill divine: And, pulling now the rein my horse to stop, I saw three pillars standing in a line,-- The last stone-pillar on a dark hill-top. The trees were grey, with neither arms nor head; Half wasted the square mound of tawny green; So that you just might say, as then I said, "Here in old time the hand of man hath been." I looked upon the hill both far and near, More doleful place did never eye survey; It seemed as if the spring-time came not here, And Nature here were willing to decay. I stood in various thoughts and fancies lost, When one, who was in shepherd\'s garb attired, Came up the hollow:--him did I accost, And what this place might be I then inquired. The Shepherd stopped, and that same story told Which in my former rhyme I have rehearsed. "A jolly place," said he, "in times of old! But something ails it now: the spot is curst. "You see these lifeless stumps of aspen wood-- Some say that they are beeches, others elms-- These were the bower; and here a mansion stood, The finest palace of a hundred realms! "The arbour does its own condition tell; You see the stones, the fountain, and the stream; But as to the great Lodge! you might as well Hunt half a day for a forgotten dream. "There\'s neither dog nor heifer, horse nor sheep, Will wet his lips within that cup of stone; And oftentimes, when all are fast asleep, This water doth send forth a dolorous groan. "Some say that here a murder has been done, And blood cries out for blood: but, for my part, I\'ve guessed, when I\'ve been sitting in the sun, That it was all for that unhappy Hart. "What thoughts must through the creature\'s brain have past! Even from the topmost stone, upon the steep, Are but three bounds--and look, Sir, at this last-- O Master! it has been a cruel leap. "For thirteen hours he ran a desperate race; And in my simple mind we cannot tell What cause the Hart might have to love this place, And come and make his deathbed near the well. "Here on the grass perhaps asleep he sank, Lulled by the fountain in the summer-tide; This water was perhaps the first he drank When he had wandered from his mother\'s side. "In April here beneath the flowering thorn He heard the birds their morning carols sing; And he, perhaps, for aught we know, was born Not half a furlong from that self-same spring. "Now, here is neither grass nor pleasant shade; The sun on drearier hollow never shone; So will it be, as I have often said, Till trees, and stones, and fountain, all are gone." "Grey-headed Shepherd, thou hast spoken well; Small difference lies between thy creed and mine: This Beast not unobserved by Nature fell; His death was mourned by sympathy divine. "The Being, that is in the clouds and air, That is in the green leaves among the groves, Maintains a deep and reverential care For the unoffending creatures whom he loves. "The pleasure-house is dust:--behind, before, This is no common waste, no common gloom; But Nature, in due course of time, once more Shall here put on her beauty and her bloom. "She leaves these objects to a slow decay, That what we are, and have been, may be known; But at the coming of the milder day, These monuments shall all be overgrown. "One lesson, Shepherd, let us two divide, Taught both by what she shows, and what conceals; Never to blend our pleasure or our pride With sorrow of the meanest thing that feels."\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEngland Ii\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMILTON! thou shouldst be living at this hour: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86England hath need of thee: she is a fen \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen, Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, Have forfeited their ancient English dower \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Of inward happiness. We are selfish men; \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86O raise us up, return to us again, And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power! Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart; \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86So didst thou travel on life\'s common way, In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The lowliest duties on herself did lay.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPeter Bell, A Tale\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPROLOGUE There\'s something in a flying horse, There\'s something in a huge balloon; But through the clouds I\'ll never float Until I have a little Boat, Shaped like the crescent-moon. And now I \'have\' a little Boat, In shape a very crescent-moon Fast through the clouds my boat can sail; But if perchance your faith should fail, Look up--and you shall see me soon! The woods, my Friends, are round you roaring, Rocking and roaring like a sea; The noise of danger\'s in your ears, And ye have all a thousand fears Both for my little Boat and me! Meanwhile untroubled I admire The pointed horns of my canoe; And, did not pity touch my breast, To see how ye are all distrest, Till my ribs ached, I\'d laugh at you! Away we go, my Boat and I-- Frail man ne\'er sate in such another; Whether among the winds we strive, Or deep into the clouds we dive, Each is contented with the other. Away we go--and what care we For treasons, tumults, and for wars? We are as calm in our delight As is the crescent-moon so bright Among the scattered stars. Up goes my Boat among the stars Through many a breathless field of light, Through many a long blue field of ether, Leaving ten thousand stars beneath her: Up goes my little Boat so bright! The Crab, the Scorpion, and the Bull-- We pry among them all; have shot High o\'er the red-haired race of Mars, Covered from top to toe with scars; Such company I like it not! The towns in Saturn are decayed, And melancholy Spectres throng them;-- The Pleiads, that appear to kiss Each other in the vast abyss, With joy I sail among them. Swift Mercury resounds with mirth, Great Jove is full of stately bowers; But these, and all that they contain, What are they to that tiny grain, That little Earth of ours? Then back to Earth, the dear green Earth:-- Whole ages if I here should roam, The world for my remarks and me Would not a whit the better be; I\'ve left my heart at home. See! there she is, the matchless Earth! There spreads the famed Pacific Ocean! Old Andes thrusts yon craggy spear Through the grey clouds; the Alps are here, Like waters in commotion! Yon tawny slip is Libya\'s sands; That silver thread the river Dnieper! And look, where clothed in brightest green Is a sweet Isle, of isles the Queen; Ye fairies, from all evil keep her! And see the town where I was born! Around those happy fields we span In boyish gambols;--I was lost Where I have been, but on this coast I feel I am a man. Never did fifty things at once Appear so lovely, never, never;-- How tunefully the forests ring! To hear the earth\'s soft murmuring Thus could I hang for ever! "Shame on you!" cried my little Boat, "Was ever such a homesick Loon, Within a living Boat to sit, And make no better use of it; A Boat twin-sister of the crescent-moon! "Ne\'er in the breast of full-grown Poet Fluttered so faint a heart before;-- Was it the music of the spheres That overpowered your mortal ears? --Such din shall trouble them no more. "These nether precincts do not lack Charms of their own;--then come with me; I want a comrade, and for you There\'s nothing that I would not do; Nought is there that you shall not see. "Haste! and above Siberian snows We\'ll sport amid the boreal morning; Will mingle with her lustres gliding Among the stars, the stars now hiding, And now the stars adorning. "I know the secrets of a land Where human foot did never stray; Fair is that land as evening skies, And cool, though in the depth it lies Of burning Africa. 0 "Or we\'ll into the realm of Faery, Among the lovely shades of things; The shadowy forms of mountains bare, And streams, and bowers, and ladies fair, The shades of palaces and kings! "Or, if you thirst with hardy zeal Less quiet regions to explore, Prompt voyage shall to you reveal How earth and heaven are taught to feel The might of magic lore!" "My little vagrant Form of light, My gay and beautiful Canoe, Well have you played your friendly part; As kindly take what from my heart Experience forces--then adieu! "Temptation lurks among your words; But, while these pleasures you\'re pursuing Without impediment or let, No wonder if you quite forget What on the earth is doing. "There was a time when all mankind Did listen with a faith sincere To tuneful tongues in mystery versed; \'Then\' Poets fearlessly rehearsed The wonders of a wild career. "Go--(but the world\'s a sleepy world, And \'tis, I fear, an age too late) Take with you some ambitious Youth! For, restless Wanderer! I, in truth, Am all unfit to be your mate. "Long have I loved what I behold, The night that calms, the day that cheers; The common growth of mother-earth Suffices me--her tears, her mirth, Her humblest mirth and tears. "The dragon\'s wing, the magic ring, I shall not covet for my dower, If I along that lowly way With sympathetic heart may stray, And with a soul of power. "These given, what more need I desire To stir, to soothe, or elevate? What nobler marvels than the mind May in life\'s daily prospect find, May find or there create? "A potent wand doth Sorrow wield; What spell so strong as guilty Fear! Repentance is a tender Sprite; If aught on earth have heavenly might, \'Tis lodged within her silent tear. "But grant my wishes,--let us now Descend from this ethereal height; Then take thy way, adventurous Skiff, More daring far than Hippogriff, And be thy own delight! "To the stone-table in my garden, Loved haunt of many a summer hour, The Squire is come: his daughter Bess Beside him in the cool recess Sits blooming like a flower. "With these are many more convened; They know not I have been so far;-- I see them there, in number nine, Beneath the spreading Weymouth-pine! I see them--there they are! "There sits the Vicar and his Dame; And there my good friend, Stephen Otter; And, ere the light of evening fail, To them I must relate the Tale Of Peter Bell the Potter." Off flew the Boat--away she flees, Spurning her freight with indignation! And I, as well as I was able, On two poor legs, toward my stone-table Limped on with sore vexation. "O, here he is!" cried little Bess-- She saw me at the garden-door; "We\'ve waited anxiously and long," They cried, and all around me throng, Full nine of them or more! "Reproach me not--your fears be still-- Be thankful we again have met;-- Resume, my Friends! within the shade Your seats, and quickly shall be paid The well-remembered debt." I spake with faltering voice, like one Not wholly rescued from the pale Of a wild dream, or worse illusion; But, straight, to cover my confusion, Began the promised Tale. PART FIRST ALL by the moonlight river side Groaned the poor Beast--alas! in vain; The staff was raised to loftier height, And the blows fell with heavier weight As Peter struck--and struck again. "Hold!" cried the Squire, "against the rules Of common sense you\'re surely sinning; This leap is for us all too bold; Who Peter was, let that be told, And start from the beginning." 0 ----"A Potter, Sir, he was by trade," Said I, becoming quite collected; "And wheresoever he appeared, Full twenty times was Peter feared For once that Peter was respected. "He, two-and-thirty years or more, Had been a wild and woodland rover; Had heard the Atlantic surges roar On farthest Cornwall\'s rocky shore, And trod the cliffs of Dover. "And he had seen Caernarvon\'s towers, And well he knew the spire of Sarum; And he had been where Lincoln bell Flings o\'er the fen that ponderous knell-- A far-renowned alarum! "At Doncaster, at York, and Leeds, And merry Carlisle had be been; And all along the Lowlands fair, All through the bonny shire of Ayr And far as Aberdeen. "And he had been at Inverness; And Peter, by the mountain-rills, Had danced his round with Highland lasses; And he had lain beside his asses On lofty Cheviot Hills: "And he had trudged through Yorkshire dales, Among the rocks and winding \'scars\', Where deep and low the hamlets lie Beneath their little patch of sky And little lot of stars: "And all along the indented coast, Bespattered with the salt-sea foam; Where\'er a knot of houses lay On headland, or in hollow bay;-- Sure never man like him did roam! "As well might Peter, in the Fleet, Have been fast bound, a begging debtor;-- He travelled here, he travelled there,-- But not the value of a hair Was heart or head the better. "He roved among the vales and streams, In the green wood and hollow dell; They were his dwellings night and day,-- But nature ne\'er could find the way Into the heart of Peter Bell. "In vain, through every changeful year, Did Nature lead him as before; A primrose by a river\'s brim A yellow primrose was to him, And it was nothing more. "Small change it made on Peter\'s heart To see his gentle panniered train With more than vernal pleasure feeding, Where\'er the tender grass was leading Its earliest green along the lane. "In vain, through water, earth, and air, The soul of happy sound was spread, When Peter on some April morn, Beneath the broom or budding thorn, Made the warm earth his lazy bed. "At noon, when, by the forest\'s edge He lay beneath the branches high, The soft blue shy did never melt Into his heart; he never felt The witchery of the soft blue sky! "On a fair prospect some have looked And felt, as I have heard them say, As if the moving time had been A thing as steadfast as the scene On which they gazed themselves away. "Within the breast of Peter Bell These silent raptures found no place; He was a Carl as wild and rude As ever hue-and-cry pursued, As ever ran a felon\'s race. "Of all that lead a lawless life, Of all that love their lawless lives, In city or in village small, He was the wildest far of all;-- He had a dozen wedded wives. "Nay, start not!--wedded wives--and twelve! But how one wife could e\'er come near him, In simple truth I cannot tell; For, be it said of Peter Bell To see him was to fear him. "Though Nature could not touch his heart By lovely forms, and silent weather, And tender sounds, yet you might see At once, that Peter Bell and she Had often been together. "A savage wildness round him hung As of a dweller out of doors; In his whole figure and his mien A savage character was seen Of mountains and of dreary moors. "To all the unshaped half-human thoughts Which solitary Nature feeds \'Mid summer storms or winter\'s ice, Had Peter joined whatever vice The cruel city breeds. 0 "His face was keen as is the wind That cuts along the hawthorn-fence;-- Of courage you saw little there, But, in its stead, a medley air Of cunning and of impudence. "He had a dark and sidelong walk, And long and slouching was his gait; Beneath his looks so bare and bold, You might perceive, his spirit cold Was playing with some inward bait. "His forehead wrinkled was and furred; A work, one half of which was done By thinking of his \'whens\' and \'hows;\' And half, by knitting of his brows Beneath the glaring sun. "There was a hardness in his cheek, There was a hardness in his eye, As if the man had fixed his face, In many a solitary place, Against the wind and open sky!" ONE NIGHT, (and now my little Bess! We\'ve reached at last the promised Tale:) One beautiful November night, When the full moon was shining bright Upon the rapid river Swale, Along the river\'s winding banks Peter was travelling all alone;-- Whether to buy or sell, or led By pleasure running in his head, To me was never known. He trudged along through copse and brake, He trudged along o\'er hill and dale; Nor for the moon cared he a tittle, And for the stars he cared as little, And for the murmuring river Swale. But, chancing to espy a path That promised to cut short the way As many a wiser man hath done, He left a trusty guide for one That might his steps betray. To a thick wood he soon is brought Where cheerily his course he weaves, And whistling loud may yet be heard, Though often buried, like a bird Darkling, among the boughs and leaves. But quickly Peter\'s mood is changed, And on he drives with cheeks that burn In downright fury and in wrath;-- There\'s little sign the treacherous path Will to the road return! The path grows dim, and dimmer still; Now up, now down, the Rover wends, With all the sail that he can carry, Till brought to a deserted quarry-- And there the pathway ends. He paused--for shadows of strange shape, Massy and black, before him lay; But through the dark, and through the cold, And through the yawning fissures old, Did Peter boldly press his way Right through the quarry;--and behold A scene of soft and lovely hue! Where blue and grey, and tender green, Together make as sweet a scene As ever human eye did view. Beneath the clear blue sky he saw A little field of meadow ground; But field or meadow name it not; Call it of earth a small green plot, With rocks encompassed round, The Swale flowed under the grey rocks, But he flowed quiet and unseen;-- You need a strong and stormy gale To bring the noises of the Swale To that green spot, so calm and green! And is there no one dwelling here, No hermit with his beads and glass? And does no little cottage look Upon this soft and fertile nook? Does no one live near this green grass? Across the deep and quiet spot Is Peter driving through the grass-- And now has reached the skirting trees; When, turning round his head, he sees A solitary Ass. "A Prize!" cries Peter--but he first Must spy about him far and near: There\'s not a single house in sight, No woodman\'s hut, no cottage light-- Peter, you need not fear! There\'s nothing to be seen but woods, And rocks that spread a hoary gleam, And this one Beast, that from the bed Of the green meadow hangs his head Over the silent stream. His head is with a halter bound; The halter seizing, Peter leapt Upon the Creature\'s back, and plied With ready heels his shaggy side; But still the Ass his station kept. 0 Then Peter gave a sudden jerk, A jerk that from a dungeon-floor Would have pulled up an iron ring; But still the heavy-headed Thing Stood just as he had stood before! Quoth Peter, leaping from his seat, "There is some plot against me laid;" Once more the little meadow-ground And all the hoary cliffs around He cautiously surveyed, All, all is silent--rocks and woods, All still and silent--far and near! Only the Ass, with motion dull, Upon the pivot of his skull Turns round his long left ear. Thought Peter, What can mean all this? Some ugly witchcraft must be here! --Once more the Ass, with motion dull, Upon the pivot of his skull Turned round his long left ear. Suspicion ripened into dread; Yet with deliberate action slow, His staff high-raising, in the pride Of skill, upon the sounding hide, He dealt a sturdy blow. The poor Ass staggered with the shock; And then, as if to take his ease, In quiet uncomplaining mood, Upon the spot where he had stood, Dropped gently down upon his knees: As gently on his side he fell; And by the river\'s brink did lie; And, while he lay like one that mourned, The patient Beast on Peter turned His shining hazel eye. \'Twas but one mild, reproachful look, A look more tender than severe; And straight in sorrow, not in dread, He turned the eye-ball in his head Towards the smooth river deep and clear. Upon the Beast the sapling rings; His lank sides heaved, his limbs they stirred; He gave a groan, and then another, Of that which went before the brother, And then he gave a third. All by the moonlight river side He gave three miserable groans; And not till now hath Peter seen How gaunt the Creature is,--how lean And sharp his staring bones! With legs stretched out and stiff he lay:-- No word of kind commiseration Fell at the sight from Peter\'s tongue; With hard contempt his heart was wrung, With hatred and vexation. The meagre beast lay still as death; And Peter\'s lips with fury quiver; Quoth he, "You little mulish dog, I\'ll fling your carcase like a log Head-foremost down the river!" An impious oath confirmed the threat-- Whereat from the earth on which he lay To all the echoes, south and north, And east and west, the Ass sent forth A long and clamorous bray! This outcry, on the heart of Peter, Seems like a note of joy to strike,-- Joy at the heart of Peter knocks; But in the echo of the rocks Was something Peter did not like. Whether to cheer his coward breast, Or that he could not break the chain, In this serene and solemn hour, Twined round him by demoniac power, To the blind work he turned again. Among the rocks and winding crags; Among the mountains far away; Once more the ass did lengthen out More ruefully a deep-drawn shout, The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray! What is there now in Peter\'s heart! Or whence the might of this strange sound? The moon uneasy looked and dimmer, The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer, And the rocks staggered all around-- From Peter\'s hand the sapling dropped! Threat has he none to execute; "If any one should come and see That I am here, they\'ll think," quoth he, "I\'m helping this poor dying brute." He scans the Ass from limb to limb, And ventures now to uplift his eyes; More steady looks the moon, and clear More like themselves the rocks appear And touch more quiet skies. His scorn returns--his hate revives; He stoops the Ass\'s neck to seize With malice--that again takes flight; For in the pool a startling sight Meets him, among the inverted trees. 0 Is it the moon\'s distorted face? The ghost-like image of a cloud? Is it a gallows there portrayed? Is Peter of himself afraid? Is it a coffin,--or a shroud? A grisly idol hewn in stone? Or imp from witch\'s lap let fall? Perhaps a ring of shining fairies? Such as pursue their feared vagaries In sylvan bower, or haunted hall? Is it a fiend that to a stake Of fire his desperate self is tethering? Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell In solitary ward or cell, Ten thousand miles from all his brethren? Never did pulse so quickly throb, And never heart so loudly panted; He looks, he cannot choose but look; Like some one reading in a book-- A book that is enchanted. Ah, well-a-day for Peter Bell! He will be turned to iron soon, Meet Statue for the court of Fear! His hat is up--and every hair Bristles, and whitens in the moon! He looks, he ponders, looks again; He sees a motion--hears a groan; His eyes will burst--his heart will break-- He gives a loud and frightful shriek, And back he falls, as if his life were flown! PART SECOND WE left our Hero in a trance, Beneath the alders, near the river; The Ass is by the river-side, And, where the feeble breezes glide, Upon the stream the moonbeams quiver. A happy respite! but at length He feels the glimmering of the moon; Wakes with glazed eve. and feebly signing-- To sink, perhaps, where he is lying, Into a second swoon! He lifts his head, he sees his staff; He touches--\'tis to him a treasure! Faint recollection seems to tell That he is yet where mortals dwell-- A thought received with languid pleasure! His head upon his elbow propped, Becoming less and less perplexed, Sky-ward he looks--to rock and wood-- And then--upon the glassy flood His wandering eye is fixed. Thought he, that is the face of one In his last sleep securely bound! So toward the stream his head he bent, And downward thrust his staff, intent The river\'s depth to sound. \'Now\'--like a tempest-shattered bark, That overwhelmed and prostrate lies, And in a moment to the verge Is lifted of a foaming surge-- Full suddenly the Ass doth rise! His staring bones all shake with joy, And close by Peter\'s side he stands: While Peter o\'er the river bends, The little Ass his neck extends, And fondly licks his hands. Such life is in the Ass\'s eyes, Such life is in his limbs and ears; That Peter Bell, if he had been The veriest coward ever seen, Must now have thrown aside his fears. The Ass looks on--and to his work Is Peter quietly resigned; He touches here--he touches there-- And now among the dead man\'s hair His sapling Peter has entwined. He pulls--and looks--and pulls again; And he whom the poor Ass had lost, The man who had been four days dead, Head-foremost from the river\'s bed Uprises like a ghost! And Peter draws him to dry land; And through the brain of Peter pass Some poignant twitches, fast and faster, "No doubt," quoth he, "he is the Master Of this poor miserable Ass!" The meagre Shadow that looks on-- What would he now? what is he doing? His sudden fit of joy is flown,-- He on his knees hath laid him down, As if he were his grief renewing; But no--that Peter on his back Must mount, he shows well as he can: Thought Peter then, come weal or woe, I\'ll do what he would have me do, In pity to this poor drowned man. With that resolve he boldly mounts Upon the pleased and thankful Ass; And then, without a moment\'s stay, That earnest Creature turned away Leaving the body on the grass. 0 Intent upon his faithful watch, The Beast four days and nights had past; A sweeter meadow ne\'er was seen, And there the Ass four days had been, Nor ever once did break his fast: Yet firm his step, and stout his heart; The mead is crossed--the quarry\'s mouth Is reached; but there the trusty guide Into a thicket turns aside, And deftly ambles towards the south. When hark a burst of doleful sound! And Peter honestly might say, The like came never to his ears, Though he has been, full thirty years, A rover--night and day! \'Tis not a plover of the moors, \'Tis not a bittern of the fen; Nor can it be a barking fox, Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks, Nor wild-cat in a woody glen! The Ass is startled--and stops short Right in the middle of the thicket; And Peter, wont to whistle loud Whether alone or in a crowd, Is silent as a silent cricket. What ails you now, my little Bess? Well may you tremble and look grave! This cry--that rings along the wood, This cry--that floats adown the flood, Comes from the entrance of a cave: I see a blooming Wood-boy there, And if I had the power to say How sorrowful the wanderer is, Your heart would be as sad as his Till you had kissed his tears away! Grasping a hawthorn branch in hand, All bright with berries ripe and red, Into the cavern\'s mouth he peeps; Thence back into the moonlight creeps; Whom seeks he--whom?--the silent dead: His father!--Him doth he require-- Him hath he sought with fruitless pains, Among the rocks, behind the trees; Now creeping on his hands and knees, Now running o\'er the open plains. And hither is he come at last, When he through such a day has gone, By this dark cave to be distrest Like a poor bird--her plundered nest Hovering around with dolorous moan! Of that intense and piercing cry The listening Ass conjectures well; Wild as it is, he there can read Some intermingled notes that plead With touches irresistible. But Peter--when he saw the Ass Not only stop but turn, and change The cherished tenor of his pace That lamentable cry to chase-- It wrought in him conviction strange; A faith that, for the dead man\'s sake And this poor slave who loved him well, Vengeance upon his head will fall, Some visitation worse than all Which ever till this night befell. Meanwhile the Ass to reach his home, Is striving stoutly as he may; But, while he climbs the woody hill, The cry grows weak--and weaker still; And now at last it dies away. So with his freight the Creature turns Into a gloomy grove of beech, Along the shade with footsteps true Descending slowly, till the two The open moonlight reach. And there, along the narrow dell, A fair smooth pathway you discern, A length of green and open road-- As if it from a fountain flowed-- Winding away between the fern. The rocks that tower on either side Build up a wild fantastic scene; Temples like those among the Hindoos, And mosques, and spires, and abbey windows, And castles all with ivy green! And, while the Ass pursues his way, Along this solitary dell, As pensively his steps advance, The mosques and spires change countenance And look at Peter Bell! That unintelligible cry Hath left him high in preparation,-- Convinced that he, or soon or late, This very night will meet his fate-- And so he sits in expectation! The strenuous Animal hath clomb With the green path; and now he wends Where, shining like the smoothest sea, In undisturbed immensity A level plain extends. 0 But whence this faintly-rustling sound By which the journeying pair are chased? --A withered leaf is close behind, Light plaything for the sportive wind Upon that solitary waste. When Peter spied the moving thing, It only doubled his distress; "Where there is not a bush or tree, The very leaves they follow me-- So huge hath been my wickedness!" To a close lane they now are come, Where, as before, the enduring Ass Moves on without a moment\'s stop, Nor once turns round his head to crop A bramble-leaf or blade of grass. Between the hedges as they go, The white dust sleeps upon the lane; And Peter, ever and anon Back-looking, sees, upon a stone, Or in the dust, a crimson stain. A stain--as of a drop of blood By moonlight made more faint and wan; Ha! why these sinkings of despair? He knows not how the blood comes there-- And Peter is a wicked man. At length he spies a bleeding wound, Where he had struck the Ass\'s head; He sees the blood, knows what it is,-- A glimpse of sudden joy was his, But then it quickly fled; Of him whom sudden death had seized He thought,--of thee, O faithful Ass! And once again those ghastly pains, Shoot to and fro through heart and reins, And through his brain like lightning pass. PART THIRD I\'VE heard of one, a gentle Soul, Though given to sadness and to gloom, And for the fact will vouch,--one night It chanced that by a taper\'s light This man was reading in his room; Bending, as you or I might bend At night o\'er any pious book, When sudden blackness overspread The snow-white page on which he read, And made the good man round him look. The chamber walls were dark all round,-- And to his book he turned again; --The light had left the lonely taper, And formed itself upon the paper Into large letters--bright and plain! The godly book was in his hand-- And, on the page, more black than coal, Appeared, set forth in strange array, A \'word\'--which to his dying day Perplexed the good man\'s gentle soul. The ghostly word, thus plainly seen, Did never from his lips depart; But he hath said, poor gentle wight! It brought full many a sin to light Out of the bottom of his heart. Dread Spirits! to confound the meek Why wander from your course so far, Disordering colour, form, and stature! --Let good men feel the soul of nature, And see things as they are. Yet, potent Spirits! well I know, How ye, that play with soul and sense, Are not unused to trouble friends Of goodness, for most gracious ends-- And this I speak in reverence! But might I give advice to you, Whom in my fear I love so well; From men of pensive virtue go, Dread Beings! and your empire show On hearts like that of Peter Bell. Your presence often have I felt In darkness and the stormy night; And, with like force, if need there be, Ye can put forth your agency When earth is calm, and heaven is bright. Then, coming from the wayward world, That powerful world in which ye dwell, Come, Spirits of the Mind! and try To-night, beneath the moonlight sky, What may be done with Peter Bell! --O, would that some more skilful voice My further labour might prevent! Kind Listeners, that around me sit, I feel that I am all unfit For such high argument. I\'ve played, I\'ve danced, with my narration; I loitered long ere I began: Ye waited then on my good pleasure; Pour out indulgence still, in measure As liberal as ye can! Our Travellers, ye remember well, Are thridding a sequestered lane; And Peter many tricks is trying, And many anodynes applying, To ease his conscience of its pain. 0 By this his heart is lighter far; And, finding that he can account So snugly for that crimson stain, His evil spirit up again Does like an empty bucket mount. And Peter is a deep logician Who hath no lack of wit mercurial; "Blood drops--leaves rustle--yet," quoth he, "This poor man never, but for me, Could have had Christian burial. "And, say the best you can, \'tis plain, That here has been some wicked dealing; No doubt the devil in me wrought; I\'m not the man who could have thought An Ass like this was worth the stealing!" So from his pocket Peter takes His shining horn tobacco-box; And, in a light and careless way, As men who with their purpose play, Upon the lid he knocks. Let them whose voice can stop the clouds, Whose cunning eye can see the wind, Tell to a curious world the cause Why, making here a sudden pause, The Ass turned round his head, and \'grinned\'. Appalling process! I have marked The like on heath, in lonely wood; And, verily, have seldom met A spectacle more hideous--yet It suited Peter\'s present mood. And, grinning in his turn, his teeth He in jocose defiance showed-- When, to upset his spiteful mirth, A murmur, pent within the earth, In the dead earth beneath the road Rolled audibly! it swept along, A muffled noise--a rumbling sound!-- \'Twas by a troop of miners made, Plying with gunpowder their trade, Some twenty fathoms under ground. Small cause of dire effect! for, surely, If ever mortal, King or Cotter, Believed that earth was charged to quake And yawn for his unworthy sake, \'Twas Peter Bell the Potter. But, as an oak in breathless air Will stand though to the centre hewn; Or as the weakest things, if frost Have stiffened them, maintain their post; So he, beneath the gazing moon!-- The Beast bestriding thus, he reached A spot where, in a sheltering cove, A little chapel stands alone, With greenest ivy overgrown, And tufted with an ivy grove; Dying insensibly away From human thoughts and purposes, It seemed--wall, window, roof and tower-- To bow to some transforming power, And blend with the surrounding trees. As ruinous a place it was, Thought Peter, in the shire of Fife That served my turn, when following still From land to land a reckless will I married my sixth wife! The unheeding Ass moves slowly on, And now is passing by an inn Brim-full of a carousing crew, That make, with curses not a few, An uproar and a drunken din. I cannot well express the thoughts Which Peter in those noises found;-- A stifling power compressed his frame, While-as a swimming darkness came Over that dull and dreary sound. For well did Peter know the sound; The language of those drunken joys To him, a jovial soul, I ween, But a few hours ago, had been A gladsome and a welcome noise. \'Now\', turned adrift into the past, He finds no solace in his course; Like planet-stricken men of yore, He trembles, smitten to the core By strong compunction and remorse. But, more than all, his heart is stung To think of one, almost a child; A sweet and playful Highland girl, As light and beauteous as a squirrel, As beauteous and as wild! Her dwelling was a lonely house, A cottage in a heathy dell; And she put on her gown of green, And left her mother at sixteen, And followed Peter Bell. But many good and pious thoughts Had she; and, in the kirk to pray, Two long Scotch miles, through rain or snow To kirk she had been used to go, Twice every Sabbath-day. 0 And, when she followed Peter Bell, It was to lead an honest life; For he, with tongue not used to falter, Had pledged his troth before the altar To love her as his wedded wife. A mother\'s hope is hers;--but soon She drooped and pined like one forlorn; From Scripture she a name did borrow; Benoni, or the child of sorrow, She called her babe unborn. For she had learned how Peter lived, And took it in most grievous part; She to the very bone was worn, And, ere that little child was born, Died of a broken heart. And now the Spirits of the Mind Are busy with poor Peter Bell; Upon the rights of visual sense Usurping, with a prevalence More terrible than magic spell. Close by a brake of flowering furze (Above it shivering aspens play) He sees an unsubstantial creature, His very self in form and feature, Not four yards from the broad highway: And stretched beneath the furze he sees The Highland girl--it is no other; And hears her crying as she cried, The very moment that she died, "My mother! oh my mother!" The sweat pours down from Peter\'s face, So grievous is his heart\'s contrition; With agony his eye-balls ache While he beholds by the furze-brake This miserable vision! Calm is the well-deserving brute, \'His\' peace hath no offence betrayed; But now, while down that slope he wends, A voice to Peter\'s ear ascends, Resounding from the woody glade: The voice, though clamorous as a horn Re-echoed by a naked rock, Comes from that tabernacle--List! Within, a fervent Methodist Is preaching to no heedless flock! "Repent! repent!" he cries aloud, "While yet ye may find mercy;--strive To love the Lord with all your might; Turn to him, seek him day and night, And save your souls alive! "Repent! repent! though ye have gone, Through paths of wickedness and woe, After the Babylonian harlot; And, though your sins be red as scarlet, They shall be white as snow!" Even as he passed the door, these words Did plainly come to Peter\'s ears; And they such joyful tidings were, The joy was more than he could bear!-- He melted into tears. Sweet tears of hope and tenderness! And fast they fell, a plenteous shower! His nerves, his sinews seemed to melt; Through all his iron frame was felt A gentle, a relaxing, power! Each fibre of his frame was weak; Weak all the animal within; But, in its helplessness, grew mild And gentle as an infant child, An infant that has known no sin. \'Tis said, meek Beast! that, through Heaven\'s grace, He not unmoved did notice now The cross upon thy shoulder scored, For lasting impress, by the Lord To whom all human-kind shall bow; Memorial of his touch--that day When Jesus humbly deigned to ride, Entering the proud Jerusalem, By an immeasurable stream Of shouting people deified! Meanwhile the persevering Ass, Turned towards a gate that hung in view Across a shady lane; his chest Against the yielding gate he pressed And quietly passed through. And up the stony lane he goes; No ghost more softly ever trod; Among the stones and pebbles, he Sets down his hoofs inaudibly, As if with felt his hoofs were shod. Along the lane the trusty Ass Went twice two hundred yards or more, And no one could have guessed his aim,-- Till to a lonely house he came, And stopped beside the door. Thought Peter, \'tis the poor man\'s home! He listens--not a sound is heard Save from the trickling household rill; But, stepping o\'er the cottage-sill, Forthwith a little Girl appeared. 00 She to the Meeting-house was bound In hopes some tidings there to gather: No glimpse it is, no doubtful gleam; She saw--and uttered with a scream, "My father! here\'s my father!" The very word was plainly heard, Heard plainly by the wretched Mother-- Her joy was like a deep affright: And forth she rushed into the light, And saw it was another! 10 And, instantly, upon the earth, Beneath the full moon shining bright, Close to the Ass\'s feet she fell; At the same moment Peter Bell Dismounts in most unhappy plight. As he beheld the Woman lie Breathless and motionless, the mind Of Peter sadly was confused; But, though to such demands unused, And helpless almost as the blind, He raised her up; and, while he held Her body propped against his knee, The Woman waked--and when she spied The poor Ass standing by her side, She moaned most bitterly. "Oh! God be praised--my heart\'s at ease-- For he is dead--I know it well!" --At this she wept a bitter flood; And, in the best way that he could, His tale did Peter tell. He trembles--he is pale as death; His voice is weak with perturbation; He turns aside his head, he pauses; Poor Peter, from a thousand causes, Is crippled sore in his narration. At length she learned how he espied The Ass in that small meadow-ground; And that her Husband now lay dead, Beside that luckless river\'s bed In which he had been drowned. A piercing look the Widow cast Upon the Beast that near her stands; She sees \'tis he, that \'tis the same; She calls the poor Ass by his name, And wrings, and wrings her hands. "O wretched loss--untimely stroke! If he had died upon his bed! He knew not one forewarning pain; He never will come home again-- Is dead, for ever dead!" Beside the woman Peter stands; His heart is opening more and more; A holy sense pervades his mind; He feels what he for human kind Had never felt before. At length, by Peter\'s arm sustained, The Woman rises from the ground-- "Oh, mercy! something must be done, My little Rachel, you must run,-- Some willing neighbour must be found. "Make haste--my little Rachel--do, The first you meet with--bid him come, Ask him to lend his horse to-night, And this good Man, whom Heaven requite, Will help to bring the body home." Away goes Rachel weeping loud;-- An Infant, waked by her distress, Makes in the house a piteous cry; And Peter hears the Mother sigh, "Seven are they, and all fatherless!" And now is Peter taught to feel That man\'s heart is a holy thing; And Nature, through a world of death, Breathes into him a second breath, More searching than the breath of spring. Upon a stone the Woman sits In agony of silent grief-- From his own thoughts did Peter start; He longs to press her to his heart, From love that cannot find relief. But roused, as if through every limb Had past a sudden shock of dread, The Mother o\'er the threshold flies, And up the cottage stairs she hies, And on the pillow lays her burning head. And Peter turns his steps aside Into a shade of darksome trees, Where he sits down, he knows not how, With his hands pressed against his brow, His elbows on his tremulous knees. There, self-involved, does Peter sit Until no sign of life he makes, As if his mind were sinking deep Through years that have been long asleep The trance is passed away--he wakes; He lifts his head--and sees the Ass Yet standing in the clear moonshine; "When shall I be as good as thou? Oh! would, poor beast, that I had now A heart but half as good as thine!" 0 But \'He\'--who deviously hath sought His Father through the lonesome woods, Hath sought, proclaiming to the ear Of night his grief and sorrowful fear-- He comes, escaped from fields and floods;-- With weary pace is drawing nigh; He sees the Ass--and nothing living Had ever such a fit of joy As hath this little orphan Boy, For he has no misgiving! Forth to the gentle Ass he springs, And up about his neck he climbs; In loving words he talks to him, He kisses, kisses face and limb,-- He kisses him a thousand times! This Peter sees, while in the shade He stood beside the cottage-door; And Peter Bell, the ruffian wild, Sobs loud, he sobs even like a child, "O God! I can endure no more!" --Here ends my Tale: for in a trice Arrived a neighbour with his horse; Peter went forth with him straightway; And, with due care, ere break of day, Together they brought back the Corse. And many years did this poor Ass, Whom once it was my luck to see Cropping the shrubs of Leming-Lane, Help by his labour to maintain The Widow and her family. And Peter Bell, who, till that night, Had been the wildest of his clan, Forsook his crimes, renounced his folly, And, after ten months\' melancholy, Became a good and honest man.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAmong All Lovely Things My Love Had Been\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAMONG all lovely things my Love had been;Had noted well the stars, all flowers that grewAbout her home; but she had never seenA glow-worm, never one, and this I knew.While riding near her home one stormy nightA single glow-worm did I chance to espy;I gave a fervent welcome to the sight,And from my horse I leapt; great joy had I.Upon a leaf the glow-worm did I lay,To bear it with me through the stormy night: And, as before, it shone without dismay;Albeit putting forth a fainter light.When to the dwelling of my Love I came,I went into the orchard quietly;And left the glow-worm, blessing it by name,Laid safely by itself, beneath a tree.The whole next day, I hoped, and hoped with fear;At night the glow-worm shone beneath the tree;I led my Lucy to the spot, \'Look here,\'Oh! joy it was for her, and joy for me!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Last Of The Flock\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI In distant countries have I been, And yet I have not often seen A healthy man, a man full grown, Weep in the public roads, alone. But such a one, on English ground, And in the broad highway, I met; Along the broad highway he came, His cheeks with tears were wet: Sturdy he seemed, though he was sad; And in his arms a Lamb he had. II He saw me, and he turned aside, As if he wished himself to hide: And with his coat did then essay To wipe those briny tears away. I followed him, and said, \'My friend, What ails you? wherefore weep you so?\' --\'Shame on me, Sir! this lusty Lamb, He makes my tears to flow. To-day I fetched him from the rock; He is the last of all my flock, III \'When I was young, a single man, And after youthful follies ran, Though little given to care and thought, Yet, so it was, an ewe I bought; And other sheep from her I raised, As healthy sheep as you might see; And then I married, and was rich As I could wish to be; Of sheep I numbered a full score, And every year increased my store. IV \'Year after year my stock it grew; And from this one, this single ewe, Full fifty comely sheep I raised, As fine a flock as ever grazed! Upon the Quantock hills they fed; They throve, and we at home did thrive: --This lusty Lamb of all my store Is all that is alive; And now I care not if we die, And perish all of poverty. V \'Six Children, Sir! had I to feed; Hard labour in a time of need! My pride was tamed, and in our grief I of the Parish asked relief. They said, I was a wealthy man; My sheep upon the uplands fed, And it was fit that thence I took Whereof to buy us bread. \'Do this: how can we give to you,\' They cried, \'what to the poor is due?\' VI \'I sold a sheep, as they had said, And bought my little children bread, And they were healthy with their food For me--it never did me good. A woeful time it was for me, To see the end of all my gains, The pretty flock which I had reared With all my care and pains, To see it melt like snow away-- For me it was a woeful day. VII \'Another still! and still another! A little lamb, and then its mother! It was a vein that never stopped-- Like blood-drops from my heart they dropped. \'Till thirty were not left alive They dwindled, dwindled, one by one And I may say, that many a time I wished they all were gone-- Reckless of what might come at last Were but the bitter struggle past. VIII \'To wicked deeds I was inclined, And wicked fancies crossed my mind; And every man I chanced to see, I thought he knew some ill of me: No peace, no comfort could I find, No ease, within doors or without; And, crazily and wearily I went my work about; And oft was moved to flee from home, And hide my head where wild beasts roam. IX \'Sir! \'twas a precious flock to me, As dear as my own children be; For daily with my growing store I loved my children more and more. Alas! it was an evil time; God cursed me in my sore distress; I prayed, yet every day I thought I loved my children less; And every week, and every day, My flock it seemed to melt away. X \'They dwindled, Sir, sad sight to see! From ten to five, from five to three, A lamb, a wether, and a ewe;-- And then at last from three to two; And, of my fifty, yesterday I had but only one: And here it lies upon my arm, Alas! and I have none;-- To-day I fetched it from the rock; It is the last of all my flock.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSurprised By Joy\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSurprised By JoySurprised by joy \\\'f3 impatient as the WindI turned to share the transport--Oh! with whomBut Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb,That spot which no vicissitude can find?Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind--But how could I forget thee?

But take it in good part:--alas! the poor Vitruvius of our village had no help From the great City; never, upon leaves Of red Morocco folio, saw displayed, In long succession, pre-existing ghosts Of Beauties yet unborn--the rustic Lodge Antique, and Cottage with verandah graced, Nor lacking, for fit company, alcove, Green-house, shell-grot, and moss-lined hermitage. Thou see\'st a homely Pile, yet to these walls The heifer comes in the snow-storm, and here The new-dropped lamb finds shelter from the wind. And hither does one Poet sometimes row His pinnace, a small vagrant barge, up-piled With plenteous store of heath and withered fern, (A lading which he with his sickle cuts, Among the mountains) and beneath this roof He makes his summer couch, and here at noon Spreads out his limbs, while, yet unshorn, the Sheep, Panting beneath the burthen of their wool, Lie round him, even as if they were a part Of his own Household: nor, while from his bed He looks, through the open door-place, toward the lake And to the stirring breezes, does he want Creations lovely as the work of sleep-- Fair sights, and visions of romantic joy!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOde Composed On A May Morning\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHILE from the purpling east departs     The star that led the dawn,Blithe Flora from her couch upstarts,     For May is on the lawn.A quickening hope, a freshening glee,     Foreran the expected Power,Whose first-drawn breath, from bush and tree,     Shakes off that pearly shower.All Nature welcomes Her whose sway     Tempers the year\'s extremes;Who scattereth lustres o\'er noon-day,     Like morning\'s dewy gleams;While mellow warble, sprightly trill,     The tremulous heart excite;And hums the balmy air to still     The balance of delight. Time was, blest Power! when youth and maids     At peep of dawn would rise,And wander forth, in forest glades     Thy birth to solemnize.Though mute the song---to grace the rite     Untouched the hawthorn bough,Thy Spirit triumphs o\'er the slight;     Man changes, but not Thou!Thy feathered Lieges bill and wings     In love\'s disport employ;Warmed by thy influence, creeping things     Awake to silent joy:Queen art thou still for each gay plant     Where the slim wild deer roves;And served in depths where fishes haunt     Their own mysterious groves.Cloud-piercing peak, and trackless heath,     Instinctive homage pay;Nor wants the dim-lit cave a wreath     To honor thee, sweet May!Where cities fanned by thy brisk airs     Behold a smokeless sky,Their puniest flower-pot-nursling dares     To open a bright eye.And if, on this thy natal morn,     The pole, from which thy nameHath not departed, stands forlorn     Of song and dance and game;Still from the village-green a vow     Aspires to thee addrest,Wherever peace is on the brow,     Or love within the breast.Yes! where Love nestles thou canst teach     The soul to love the more;Hearts also shall thy lessons reach     That never loved before.Stript is the haughty one of pride,     The bashful freed from fear,While rising, like the ocean-tide,     In flow the joyous year.Hush, feeble lyre! weak words refuse     The service to prolong!To yon exulting thrush the Muse     Entrusts the imperfect song;His voice shall chant, in accents clear,     Throughout the live-long day,Till the first silver star appear,     The sovereignty of May.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nExtempore Effusion Upon The Death Of James Hogg\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.  When first, descending from the moorlands,    I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide   Along a bare and open valley,   The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide.   When last along its banks I wandered,   Through groves that had begun to shed   Their golden leaves upon the pathways,   My steps the Border-minstrel led.   The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer,  \'Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;  And death upon the braes of Yarrow,  Has closed the Shepherd-poet\'s eyes:  Nor has the rolling year twice measured,  From sign to sign, its stedfast course,  Since every mortal power of Coleridge  Was frozen at its marvellous source;  The rapt One, of the godlike forehead,  The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:  And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,  Has vanished from his lonely hearth.  Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,  Or waves that own no curbing hand,  How fast has brother followed brother,  From sunshine to the sunless land!  Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber  Were earlier raised, remain to hear  A timid voice, that asks in whispers,  "Who next will drop and disappear?"  Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,  Like London with its own black wreath,  On which with thee, O Crabbe! forth-looking,  I gazed from Hampstead\'s breezy heath.  As if but yesterday departed,  Thou too art gone before; but why,  O\'er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,  Should frail survivors heave a sigh?  Mourn rather for that holy Spirit,  Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;  For Her who, ere her summer faded,  Has sunk into a breathless sleep.  No more of old romantic sorrows,  For slaughtered Youth or love-lorn Maid!  With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten,  And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLaodamia\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.  "With sacrifice before the rising morn    Vows have I made by fruitless hope inspired;   And from the infernal Gods, \'mid shades forlorn   Of night, my slaughtered Lord have I required:   Celestial pity I again implore;--   Restore him to my sight--great Jove, restore!"   So speaking, and by fervent love endowed   With faith, the Suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;   While, like the sun emerging from a cloud,  Her countenance brightens--and her eye expands;  Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;  As she expects the issue in repose.  O terror! what hath she perceived?--O joy!  What doth she look on?--whom doth she behold?  Her Hero slain upon the beach of Troy?  His vital presence? his corporeal mould?  It is--if sense deceive her not--\'tis He!  And a God leads him, wing\\\'cbd Mercury!  Mild Hermes spake--and touched her with his wand  That calms all fear; "Such grace hath crowned thy prayer,  Laodam\\\'cca! that at Jove\'s command  Thy husband walks the paths of upper air:  He comes to tarry with thee three hours\' space;  Accept the gift, behold him face to face!"  Forth sprang the impassioned Queen her Lord to clasp;  Again that consummation she essayed;  But unsubstantial Form eludes her grasp  As often as that eager grasp was made.  The Phantom parts--but parts to re-unite,  And re-assume his place before her sight.  "Protesil\\\'b7us, lo! thy guide is gone!  Confirm, I pray, the vision with thy voice:  This is our palace,--yonder is thy throne;  Speak, and the floor thou tread\'st on will rejoice.  Not to appal me have the gods bestowed  This precious boon; and blest a sad abode."  "Great Jove, Laodam\\\'cca! doth not leave  His gifts imperfect:--Spectre though I be,  I am not sent to scare thee or deceive;  But in reward of thy fidelity.  And something also did my worth obtain;  For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain.  "Thou knowest, the Delphic oracle foretold  That the first Greek who touched the Trojan strand  Should die; but me the threat could not withhold:  A generous cause a victim did demand;  And forth I leapt upon the sandy plain;  A self-devoted chief--by Hector slain."  "Supreme of Heroes--bravest, noblest, best!  Thy matchless courage I bewail no more,  Which then, when tens of thousands were deprest  By doubt, propelled thee to the fatal shore;  Thou found\'st--and I forgive thee--here thou art--  A nobler counsellor than my poor heart.  "But thou, though capable of sternest deed,  Wert kind as resolute, and good as brave;  And he, whose power restores thee, hath decreed  Thou should\'st elude the malice of the grave:  Redundant are thy locks, thy lips as fair   As when their breath enriched Thessalian air.  "No spectre greets me,--no vain Shadow this;  Come, blooming Hero, place thee by my side!  Give, on this well-known couch, one nuptial kiss  To me, this day a second time thy bride!"  Jove frowned in heaven: the conscious Parc\\\'ca threw  Upon those roseate lips a Stygian hue.  "This visage tells thee that my doom is past:  Nor should the change be mourned, even if the joys  Of sense were able to return as fast  And surely as they vanish. Earth destroys  Those raptures duly---Erebus disdains:  Calm pleasures there abide--majestic pains.  "Be taught, O faithful Consort, to control  Rebellious passion: for the Gods approve  The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul;  A fervent, not ungovernable love.  Thy transports moderate; and meekly mourn  When I depart, for brief is my sojourn--"  "Ah wherefore?--Did not Hercules by force  Wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb  Alcestis, a reanimated corse,  Given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom?  Medea\'s spells dispersed the weight of years,  And \\uc0\\u8710 son stood a youth \'mid youthful peers.  "The Gods to us are merciful--and they  Yet further may relent: for mightier far  Than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway  Of magic potent over sun and star,  Is love, though oft to agony distrest,  And though his favourite seat be feeble woman\'s breast.  "But if thou goest, I follow--" "Peace!" he said,--  She looked upon him and was calmed and cheered;  The ghastly colour from his lips had fled;  In his deportment, shape, and mien, appeared  Elysian beauty, melancholy grace,  Brought from a pensive though a happy place.  He spake of love, such love as Spirits feel  In worlds whose course is equable and pure;  No fears to beat away--no strife to heal-- The past unsighed for, and the future sure; Spake of heroic arts in graver mood Revived, with finer harmony pursued; Of all that is most beauteous--imaged there In happier beauty; more pellucid streams, An ampler ether, a diviner air, And fields invested with purpureal gleams; Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey. Yet there the Soul shall enter which hath earned That privilege by virtue.--"Ill," said he, "The end of man\'s existence I discerned, Who from ignoble games and revelry Could draw, when we had parted, vain delight, While tears were thy best pastime, day and night; "And while my youthful peers before my eyes (Each hero following his peculiar bent) Prepared themselves for glorious enterprise By martial sports,--or, seated in the tent, Chieftains and kings in council were detained; What time the fleet at Aulis lay enchained. "The wished-for wind was given:--I then revolved The oracle, upon the silent sea; And, if no worthier led the way, resolved That, of a thousand vessels, mine should be The foremost prow in pressing to the strand,-- Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand. "Yet bitter, oft-times bitter, was the pang When of thy loss I thought, belov\\\'cbd Wife! On thee too fondly did my memory hang, And on the joys we shared in mortal life,-- The paths which we had trod--these fountains, flowers: My new-planned cities, and unfinished towers. "But should suspense permit the Foe to cry, \'Behold they tremble!--haughty their array, Yet of their numbers no one dares to die?\' In soul I swept the indignity away: Old frailties then recurred:--but lofty thought, In act embodied, my deliverance wrought. "And Thou, though strong in love, art all too weak In reason, in self-government too slow; I counsel thee by fortitude to seek Our blest re-union in the shades below. The invisible world with thee hath sympathised; Be thy affections raised and solemnised. "Learn, by a mortal yearning, to ascend-- Seeking a higher object. Love was given, Encouraged, sanctioned, chiefly for that end; For this the passion to excess was driven-- That self might be annulled: her bondage prove The fetters of a dream opposed to love.-- Aloud she shrieked! for Hermes re-appears! Round the dear Shade she would have clung--\'tis vain: The hours are past--too brief had they been years; And him no mortal effort can detain: Swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day, He through the portal takes his silent way, And on the palace-floor a lifeless corse She lay. Thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved, She perished; and, as for a wilful crime, By the just Gods whom no weak pity moved, Was doomed to wear out her appointed time, Apart from happy Ghosts, that gather flowers Of blissful quiet \'mid unfading bowers. --Yet tears to human suffering are due; And mortal hopes defeated and o\'erthrown Are mourned by man, and not by man alone, As fondly he believes.--Upon the side Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained) A knot of spiry trees for ages grew From out the tomb of him for whom she died; And ever, when such stature they had gained That Ilium\'s walls were subject to their view, The trees\' tall summits withered at the sight; A constant interchange of growth and blight!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nElegiac Stanzas Suggested By A Picture Of Peele Castle\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n. I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile!    Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:   I saw thee every day; and all the while   Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.   So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!   So like, so very like, was day to day!   Whene\'er I looked, thy Image still was there;   It trembled, but it never passed away.   How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;  No mood, which season takes away, or brings:  I could have fancied that the mighty Deep  Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.  Ah!  then , if mine had been the Painter\'s hand,  To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,  The light that never was, on sea or land,  The consecration, and the Poet\'s dream;  I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile  Amid a world how different from this!  Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;  On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.  Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine  Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;--  Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine  The very sweetest had to thee been given.  A Picture had it been of lasting ease,  Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;  No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,  Or merely silent Nature\'s breathing life.  Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,  Such Picture would I at that time have made:  And seen the soul of truth in every part,  A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.  So once it would have been,--\'tis so no more;  I have submitted to a new control:  A power is gone, which nothing can restore;  A deep distress hath humanised my Soul.  Not for a moment could I now behold  A smiling sea, and be what I have been:  The feeling of my loss will ne\'er be old;  This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.  Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend,  If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,  This work of thine I blame not, but commend;  This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.  O \'tis a passionate Work!--yet wise and well,  Well chosen is the spirit that is here;  That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,  This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!  And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,  I love to see the look with which it braves,  Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,  The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves.  Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,  Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!  Such happiness, wherever it be known,  Is to be pitied; for \'tis surely blind.  But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,  And frequent sights of what is to be borne!  Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.--   Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLines Left Upon A Seat In A Yew-Tree\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNay, Traveller! rest. This lonely Yew-tree stands Far from all human dwelling: what if here No sparkling rivulet spread the verdant herb? What if the bee love not these barren boughs? Yet, if the wind breathe soft, the curling waves, That break against the shore, shall lull thy mind By one soft impulse saved from vacancy. --------------------Who he was That piled these stones and with the mossy sod First covered, and here taught this aged Tree With its dark arms to form a circling bower, I well remember.--He was one who owned No common soul. In youth by science nursed, And led by nature into a wild scene Of lofty hopes, he to the world went forth A favoured Being, knowing no desire Which genius did not hallow; \'gainst the taint Of dissolute tongues, and jealousy, and hate, And scorn,--against all enemies prepared, All but neglect. The world, for so it thought, Owed him no service; wherefore he at once With indignation turned himself away, And with the food of pride sustained his soul In solitude.--Stranger! these gloomy boughs Had charms for him; and here he loved to sit, His only visitants a straggling sheep, The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper: And on these barren rocks, with fern and heath, And juniper and thistle, sprinkled o\'er, Fixing his downcast eye, he many an hour A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here An emblem of his own unfruitful life: And, lifting up his head, he then would gaze On the more distant scene,--how lovely \'tis Thou seest,--and he would gaze till it became Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain The beauty, still more beauteous! Nor, that time, When nature had subdued him to herself, Would he forget those Beings to whose minds, Warm from the labours of benevolence, The world, and human life, appeared a scene Of kindred loveliness: then he would sigh, Inly disturbed, to think that others felt What he must never feel: and so, lost Man! On visionary views would fancy feed, Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale He died,--this seat his only monument. If Thou be one whose heart the holy forms Of young imagination have kept pure, Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know that pride, Howe\'er disguised in its own majesty, Is littleness; that he, who feels contempt For any living thing, hath faculties Which he has never used; that thought with him Is in its infancy. The man whose eye Is ever on himself doth look on one, The least of Nature\'s works, one who might move The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds Unlawful, ever. O be wiser, Thou! Instructed that true knowledge leads to love; True dignity abides with him alone Who, in the silent hour of inward thought, Can still suspect, and still revere himself In lowliness of heart.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEngland V\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWHEN I have borne in memory what has tamed \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Great Nations, how ennobling thoughts depart \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86When men change swords for ledgers, and desert The student\'s bower for gold, some fears unnamed I had, my Country!--am I to be blamed? \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Now, when I think of thee, and what thou art, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Verily, in the bottom of my heart, Of those unfilial fears I am ashamed.

Here stood his threshold; here was spread the roof That sheltered him, a self-secluded Man, After long exercise in social cares And offices humane, intent to adore The Deity, with undistracted mind, And meditate on everlasting things, In utter solitude.--But he had left A Fellow-labourer, whom the good Man loved As his own soul. And, when with eye upraised To heaven he knelt before the crucifix, While o\'er the lake the cataract of Lodore Pealed to his orisons, and when he paced Along the beach of this small isle and thought Of his Companion, he would pray that both (Now that their earthly duties were fulfilled) Might die in the same moment. Nor in vain So prayed he:--as our chronicles report, Though here the Hermit numbered his last day Far from St. Cuthbert his beloved Friend, Those holy Men both died in the same hour.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLines Written As A School Exercise At Hawkshead, Anno Aetatis\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'And has the Sun his flaming chariot driven Two hundred times around the ring of heaven, Since Science first, with all her sacred train, Beneath yon roof began her heavenly reign? While thus I mused, methought, before mine eyes, The Power of EDUCATION seemed to rise; Not she whose rigid precepts trained the boy Dead to the sense of every finer joy; Nor that vile wretch who bade the tender age Spurn Reason\'s law and humour Passion\'s rage; But she who trains the generous British youth In the bright paths of fair majestic Truth: Emerging slow from Academus\' grove In heavenly majesty she seemed to move. Stern was her forehead, but a smile serene \'Softened the terrors of her awful mien.\' Close at her side were all the powers, designed To curb, exalt, reform the tender mind: With panting breast, now pale as winter snows, Now flushed as Hebe, Emulation rose; Shame followed after with reverted eye, And hue far deeper than the Tyrian dye; Last Industry appeared with steady pace, A smile sat beaming on her pensive face. I gazed upon the visionary train, Threw back my eyes, returned, and gazed again. When lo! the heavenly goddess thus began, Through all my frame the pleasing accents ran. \'\'When Superstition left the golden light And fled indignant to the shades of night; When pure Religion reared the peaceful breast And lulled the warring passions into rest, Drove far away the savage thoughts that roll In the dark mansions of the bigot\'s soul, Enlivening Hope displayed her cheerful ray, And beamed on Britain\'s sons a brighter day; So when on Ocean\'s face the storm subsides, Hushed are the winds and silent are the tides; The God of day, in all the pomp of light, Moves through the vault of heaven, and dissipates the night; Wide o\'er the main a trembling lustre plays, The glittering waves reflect the dazzling blaze Science with joy saw Superstition fly Before the lustre of Religion\'s eye; With rapture she beheld Britannia smile, Clapped her strong wings, and sought the cheerful isle, The shades of night no more the soul involve, She sheds her beam, and, lo! the shades dissolve; No jarring monks, to gloomy cell confined, With mazy rules perplex the weary mind; No shadowy forms entice the soul aside, Secure she walks, Philosophy her guide. Britain, who long her warriors had adored, And deemed all merit centred in the sword; Britain, who thought to stain the field was fame, Now honoured Edward\'s less than Bacon\'s name. Her sons no more in listed fields advance To ride the ring, or toss the beamy lance; No longer steel their indurated hearts To the mild influence of the finer arts; Quick to the secret grotto they retire To court majestic truth, or wake the golden lyre; By generous Emulation taught to rise, The seats of learning brave the distant skies. Then noble Sandys, inspired with great design, Reared Hawkshead\'s happy roof, and called it mine. There have I loved to show the tender age The golden precepts of the classic page; To lead the mind to those Elysian plains Where, throned in gold, immortal Science reigns; Fair to the view is sacred Truth displayed, In all the majesty of light arrayed, To teach, on rapid wings, the curious soul To roam from heaven to heaven, from pole to pole, From thence to search the mystic cause of things And follow Nature to her secret springs; Nor less to guide the fluctuating youth Firm in the sacred paths of moral truth, To regulate the mind\'s disordered frame, And quench the passions kindling into flame; The glimmering fires of Virtue to enlarge, And purge from Vice\'s dross my tender charge. Oft have I said, the paths of Fame pursue, And all that Virtue dictates, dare to do; Go to the world, peruse the book of man, And learn from thence thy own defects to scan; Severely honest, break no plighted trust, But coldly rest not here- be more than just; Join to the rigours of the sires of Rome The gentler manners of the private dome; When Virtue weeps in agony of woe, Teach from the heart the tender tear to flow; If Pleasure\'s soothing song thy soul entice, Or all the gaudy pomp of splendid Vice, Arise superior to the Siren\'s power, The wretch, the short-lived vision of an hour; Soon fades her cheek, her blushing beauties fly, As fades the chequered bow that paints the sky, So shall thy sire, whilst hope his breast inspires, And wakes anew life\'s glimmering trembling fires, 0 Hear Britain\'s sons rehearse thy praise with joy, Look up to heaven, and bless his darling boy. If e\'er these precepts quelled the passions\' strife, If e\'er they smoothed the rugged walks of life, If e\'er they pointed forth the blissful way That guides the spirit to eternal day, Do thou, if gratitude inspire thy breast, Spurn the soft fetters of lethargic rest. Awake, awake! and snatch the slumbering lyre, Let this bright morn and Sandys the song inspire.\' \'I looked obedience: the celestial Fair Smiled like the morn, and vanished into air.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOde To Duty\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSTERN Daughter of the Voice of God! O Duty! if that name thou love, Who art a light to guide, a rod To check the erring and reprove; Thou, who art victory and law When empty terrors overawe; From vain temptations dost set free; And calm\'st the weary strife of frail humanity! There are who ask not if thine eye Be on them; who, in love and truth, Where no misgiving is, rely Upon the genial sense of youth: Glad hearts! without reproach or blot; Who do thy work, and know it not: O, if through confidence misplaced They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. Serene will be our days and bright, And happy will our nature be, When love is an unerring light, And joy its own security. And they a blissful course may hold Even now, who, not unwisely bold, Live in the spirit of this creed; Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need. I, loving freedom, and untried; No sport of every random gust, Yet being to myself a guide, Too blindly have reposed my trust: And oft, when in my heart was heard Thy timely mandate, I deferr\'d The task, in smoother walks to stray; But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may. Through no disturbance of my soul, Or strong compunction in me wrought, I supplicate for thy control; But in the quietness of thought. Me this uncharter\'d freedom tires; I feel the weight of chance-desires; My hopes no more must change their name, I long for a repose that ever is the same. Yet not the less would I throughout Still act according to the voice Of my own wish; and feel past doubt That my submissiveness was choice: Not seeking in the school of pride For \'precepts over dignified,\' Denial and restraint I prize No farther than they breed a second Will more wise. Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear The Godhead\'s most benignant grace; Nor know we anything so fair As is the smile upon thy face: Flowers laugh before thee on their beds, And fragrance in thy footing treads; Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong; And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong. To humbler functions, awful Power! I call thee: I myself commend Unto thy guidance from this hour; O, let my weakness have an end! Give unto me, made lowly wise, The spirit of self-sacrifice; The confidence of reason give; And in the light of truth thy bondman let me live!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Danish Boy: A Fragment\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI Between two sister moorland rills There is a spot that seems to lie Sacred to flowerets of the hills, And sacred to the sky. And in this smooth and open dell There is a tempest-stricken tree; A corner-stone by lightning cut, The last stone of a lonely hut; And in this dell you see A thing no storm can e\'er destroy, The shadow of a Danish Boy. II In clouds above, the lark is heard, But drops not here to earth for rest; Within this lonesome nook the bird Did never build her nest. No beast, no bird hath here his home; Bees, wafted on the breezy air, Pass high above those fragrant bells To other flowers:--to other dells Their burthens do they bear; The Danish Boy walks here alone: The lovely dell is all his own. III A Spirit of noon-day is he; Yet seems a form of flesh and blood; Nor piping shepherd shall he be, Nor herd-boy of the wood. A regal vest of fur he wears, In colour like a raven\'s wing; It fears not rain, nor wind, nor dew; But in the storm \'tis fresh and blue As budding pines in spring; His helmet has a vernal grace, Fresh as the bloom upon his face. IV A harp is from his shoulder slung; Resting the harp upon his knee, To words of a forgotten tongue He suits its melody. Of flocks upon the neighbouring hill He is the darling and the joy; And often, when no cause appears, The mountain-ponies prick their ears, --They hear the Danish Boy, While in the dell he sings alone Beside the tree and corner-stone. V There sits he; in his face you spy No trace of a ferocious air, Nor ever was a cloudless sky So steady or so fair. The lovely Danish Boy is blest And happy in his flowery cove: From bloody deeds his thoughts are far; And yet he warbles songs of war, That seem like songs of love, For calm and gentle is his mien; Like a dead Boy he is serene.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThree Years She Grew In Sun And Shower,\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThree years she grew in sun and shower,Then Nature said, "A lovelier flowerOn earth was never sown;This Child I to myself will take;She shall be mine, and I will makeA Lady of my own."Myself will to my darling beBoth law and impulse: and with meThe Girl, in rock and plainIn earth and heaven, in glade and bower,Shall feel an overseeing powerTo kindle or restrain."She shall be sportive as the fawnThat wild with glee across the lawnOr up the mountain springs;And her\'s shall be the breathing balm,And her\'s the silence and the calmOf mute insensate things."The floating clouds their state shall lendTo her; for her the willow bend;Nor shall she fail to seeEven in the motions of the StormGrace that shall mold the Maiden\'s formBy silent sympathy."The stars of midnight shall be dearTo her; and she shall lean her earIn many a secret placeWhere rivulets dance their wayward round,And beauty born of murmuring soundShall pass into her face."And vital feelings of delightShall rear her form to stately height,Her virgin bosom swell;Such thoughts to Lucy I will giveWhile she and I together liveHere in this happy dell."Thus Nature spake---The work was done---How soon my Lucy\'s race was run!She died, and left to meThis heath, this calm, and quiet scene;The memory of what has been,And never more will be.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nInfluence Of Natural Objects\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWisdom and Spirit of the universe! Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought! And giv\'st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion! not in vain, By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human soul; Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man; But with high objects, with enduring things, With life and nature; purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying by such discipline Both pain and fear,--until we recognise A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me With stinted kindness. In November days, When vapours rolling down the valleys made A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods At noon; and \'mid the calm of summer nights, When, by the margin of the trembling lake, Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went In solitude, such intercourse was mine: Mine was it in the fields both day and night, And by the waters, all the summer long. And in the frosty season, when the sun Was set, and, visible for many a mile, The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed, I heeded not the summons: happy time It was indeed for all of us; for me It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud The village-clock tolled six--I wheeled about, Proud and exulting like an untired horse That cares not for his home.--All shod with steel We hissed along the polished ice, in games Confederate, imitative of the chase And woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn, The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare. So through the darkness and the cold we flew, And not a voice was idle: with the din Smitten, the precipices rang aloud; The leafless trees and every icy crag Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away. Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay, or sportively Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, To cut across the reflex of a star; Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes, When we had given our bodies to the wind, And all the shadowy banks on either side Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still The rapid line of motion, then at once Have I, reclining back upon my heels, Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs Wheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled With visible motion her diurnal round! Behind me did they stretch in solemn train, Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYarrow Visited\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSeptember, 1814And is this -Yarrow? -This the streamOf which my fancy cherishedSo faithfully, a waking dream,An image that hath perished?O that some minstrel\'s harp were nearTo utter notes of gladnessAnd chase this silence from the air,That fills my heart with sadness!Yet why? -a silvery current flowsWith uncontrolled meanderings;Nor have these eyes by greener hillsBeen soothed, in all my wanderings.And, through her depths, Saint Mary\'s LakeIs visibly delighted;For not a feature of those hillsIs in the mirror slighted.A blue sky bends o\'er Yarrow Vale,Save where that pearly whitenessIs round the rising sun diffused,A tender hazy brightness;Mild dawn of promise! that excludesAll profitless dejection;Though not unwilling here to admitA pensive recollection.Where was it that the famous FlowerOf Yarrow Vale lay bleeding?His bed perchance was yon smooth moundOn which the herd is feeding:And haply from this crystal pool,Now peaceful as the morning,The Water-wraith ascended thrice,And gave his doleful warning.Delicious is the Lay that singsThe haunts of happy lovers,The path that leads them to the grove,The leafy grove that covers:And pity sanctifies the verseThat paints, by strength of sorrow,The unconquerable strength of love;Bear witness, rueful Yarrow!But thou that didst appear so fairTo fond imagination,Dost rival in the light of dayHer delicate creation:Meek loveliness is round thee spread,A softness still and holy:The grace of forest charms decayed,And pastoral melancholy.That region left, the vale unfoldsRich groves of lofty stature,With Yarrow winding through the pompOf cultivated nature;And rising from those lofty grovesBehold a ruin hoary,The shattered front of Newark\'s Towers,Renowned in Border story.Fair scenes for childhood\'s opening bloom,For sportive youth to stray in,For manhood to enjoy his strength,And age to wear away in!Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,A covert for protectionOf tender thoughts, that nestle there - The brood of chaste affection.How sweeet on this autumnal dayThe wild-wood fruits to gather,And on my true-love\'s forehead plantA crest of blooming heather!And what if I enwreathed my own?\'Twere no offence to reason;The sober hills thus deck their browsTo meet the wintry season.I see -but not by sight alone,Loved Yarrow, have I won thee;A ray of Fancy still survives - Her sunshine plays upon thee!Thy ever-youthful waters keepA course of lively pleasure;And gladsome notes my lips can breatheAccordant to the measure.The vapours linger round the heights,They melt, and soon must vanish;One hour is theirs, nor more is mine - Sad thought! which I would banish,But that I know, where\'er I go,Thy genuine image, Yarrow!Will dwell with me -to heighten joy,And cheer my mind in sorrow.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPet-Lamb, The: A Pastoral Poem\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe dew was falling fast, the stars began to blink; I heard a voice; it said, "Drink, pretty creature, drink!" And, looking o\'er the hedge, before me I espied A snow-white mountain-lamb with a Maiden at its side. Nor sheep nor kine were near; the lamb was all alone, And by a slender cord was tethered to a stone; With one knee on the grass did the little Maiden kneel, While to that mountain-lamb she gave its evening meal. The lamb, while from her hand he thus his supper took, Seemed to feast with head and ears; and his tail with pleasure shook. "Drink, pretty creature, drink," she said in such a tone That I almost received her heart into my own. \'Twas little Barbara Lewthwaite, a child of beauty rare! I watched them with delight, they were a lovely pair. Now with her empty can the Maiden turned away: But ere ten yards were gone her footsteps did she stay. Right towards the lamb she looked; and from a shady place I unobserved could see the workings of her face: If Nature to her tongue could measured numbers bring, Thus, thought I, to her lamb that little Maid might sing: "What ails thee, young One? what? Why pull so at thy cord? Is it not well with thee? well both for bed and board? Thy plot of grass is soft, and green as grass can be; Rest, little young One, rest; what is\'t that aileth thee? "What is it thou wouldst seek? What is wanting to thy heart? Thy limbs are they not strong? And beautiful thou art: This grass is tender grass; these flowers they have no peers; And that green corn all day is rustling in thy ears! "If the sun be shining hot, do but stretch thy woollen chain, This beech is standing by, its covert thou canst gain; For rain and mountain-storms! the like thou need\'st not fear, The rain and storm are things that scarcely can come here. "Rest, little young One, rest; thou hast forgot the day When my father found thee first in places far away; Many flocks were on the hills, but thou wert owned by none, And thy mother from thy side for evermore was gone. "He took thee in his arms, and in pity brought thee home: A blessed day for thee! then whither wouldst thou roam? A faithful nurse thou hast; the dam that did thee yean Upon the mountain-tops no kinder could have been. "Thou know\'st that twice a day I have brought thee in this can Fresh water from the brook, as clear as ever ran; And twice in the day, when the ground is wet with dew, I bring thee draughts of milk, warm milk it is and new. "Thy limbs will shortly be twice as stout as they are now, Then I\'ll yoke thee to my cart like a pony in the plough; My playmate thou shalt be; and when the wind is cold Our hearth shall be thy bed, our house shall be thy fold. "It will not, will not rest!--Poor creature, can it be That \'tis thy mother\'s heart which is working so in thee? Things that I know not of belike to thee are dear, And dreams of things which thou canst neither see nor hear. "Alas, the mountain-tops that look so green and fair! I\'ve heard of fearful winds and darkness that come there; The little brooks that seem all pastime and all play, When they are angry, roar like lions for their prey. "Here thou need\'st not dread the raven in the sky; Night and day thou art safe,--our cottage is hard by. Why bleat so after me? Why pull so at thy chain? Sleep--and at break of day I will come to thee again!" --As homeward through the lane I went with lazy feet, This song to myself did I oftentimes repeat; And it seemed, as I retraced the ballad line by line, That but half of it was hers, and one half of it was \'mine\'. Again, and once again, did I repeat the song; "Nay," said I, "more than half to the damsel must belong, For she looked with such a look and she spake with such a tone, That I almost received her heart into my own."\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIt Is Not To Be Thought Of\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   It is not to be thought of that the Flood    Of British freedom, which, to the open sea   Of the world\'s praise, from dark antiquity   Hath flowed, "with pomp of waters, unwithstood,"   Roused though it be full often to a mood   Which spurns the check of salutary bands,   That this most famous Stream in bogs and sands   Should perish; and to evil and to good   Be lost for ever. In our halls is hung  Armoury of the invincible Knights of old:  We must be free or die, who speak the tongue  That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold  Which Milton held.--In every thing we are sprung  Of Earth\'s first blood, have titles manifold.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nYarrow Unvisited\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n. From Stirling castle we had seen    The mazy Forth unravelled;   Had trod the banks of Clyde, and Tay,   And with the Tweed had travelled;   And when we came to Clovenford,   Then said my "winsome Marrow ,"   "Whate\'er betide, we\'ll turn aside,   And see the Braes of Yarrow."   "Let Yarrow folk,  frae Selkirk town,  Who have been buying, selling,  Go back to Yarrow, \'tis their own;  Each maiden to her dwelling!  On Yarrow\'s banks let her herons feed,  Hares couch, and rabbits burrow!  But we will downward with the Tweed  Nor turn aside to Yarrow.  "There\'s Galla Water, Leader Haughs,  Both lying right before us;  And Dryborough, where with chiming Tweed  The lintwhites sing in chorus;  There\'s pleasant Tiviot-dale, a land  Made blithe with plough and harrow:  Why throw away a needful day  To go in search of Yarrow?  "What\'s Yarrow but a river bare,  That glides the dark hills under?  There are a thousand such elsewhere  As worthy of your wonder."  --Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn;  My True-love sighed for sorrow;  And looked me in the face, to think  I thus could speak of Yarrow!  "Oh! green," said I, "are Yarrow\'s holms,  And sweet is Yarrow flowing!  Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,  But we will leave it growing.  O\'er hilly path, and open Strath,  We\'ll wander Scotland thorough;  But, though so near, we will not turn  Into the dale of Yarrow.  "Let beeves and home-bred kine partake  The sweets of Burn-mill meadow,  The swan on still St. Mary\'s Lake  Float double, swan and shadow!  We will not see them; will not go,  To-day, nor yet to-morrow;  Enough if in our hearts we know  There\'s such a place as Yarrow.  "Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!  It must, or we shall rue it:  We have a vision of our own;  Ah! why should we undo it?  The treasured dreams of times long past,  We\'ll keep them, winsome Marrow!  For when we\'er there, although \'tis fair,  \'Twill be another Yarrow!  "If Care with freezing years should come,  And wandering seem but folly,--  Should we be loth to stir from home,   And yet be melancholy;  Should life be dull, and spirits low,  \'Twill soothe us in our sorrow,  That earth has something yet to show,  The bonny holms of Yarrow!"\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMutability\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFROM low to high doth dissolution climb, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And sink from high to low, along a scale \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail; A musical but melancholy chime, Which they can hear who meddle not with crime, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care. \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear The longest date do melt like frosty rime, That in the morning whiten\'d hill and plain And is no more; drop like the tower sublime \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Of yesterday, which royally did wear His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Some casual shout that broke the silent air, Or the unimaginable touch of Time.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWritten In Early Spring\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI heard a thousand blended notesWhile in a grove I sat reclined,In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughtsBring sad thoughts to the mind.To her fair works did Nature linkThe human soul that through me ran;And much it grieved my heart to thinkWhat Man has made of Man.Through primrose tufts, in that sweet bower,The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;And \'tis my faith that every flowerEnjoys the air it breathes.The birds around me hopped and played,Their thoughts I cannot measure - But the least motion which they madeIt seemed a thrill of pleasure.The budding twigs spread out their fanTo catch the breezy air;And I must think, do all I can,That there was pleasure there.If this belief from heaven be sent,If such be Nature\'s holy plan,Have I not reason to lamentWhat Man has made of Man?\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Brothers\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'These Tourists, heaven preserve us! needs must live A profitable life: some glance along, Rapid and gay, as if the earth were air, And they were butterflies to wheel about Long as the summer lasted: some, as wise, Perched on the forehead of a jutting crag, Pencil in hand and book upon the knee, Will look and scribble, scribble on and look, Until a man might travel twelve stout miles, Or reap an acre of his neighbour\'s corn. But, for that moping Son of Idleness, Why can he tarry \'yonder\'?--In our churchyard Is neither epitaph nor monument, Tombstone nor name--only the turf we tread And a few natural graves.\' To Jane, his wife, Thus spake the homely Priest of Ennerdale. It was a July evening; and he sate Upon the long stone-seat beneath the eaves Of his old cottage,--as it chanced, that day, Employed in winter\'s work. Upon the stone His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool, While, from the twin cards toothed with glittering wire, He fed the spindle of his youngest child, Who, in the open air, with due accord Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps, Her large round wheel was turning. Towards the field In which the Parish Chapel stood alone, Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall, While half an hour went by, the Priest had sent Many a long look of wonder: and at last, Risen from his seat, beside the snow-white ridge Of carded wool which the old man had piled He laid his implements with gentle care, Each in the other locked; and, down the path That from his cottage to the church-yard led, He took his way, impatient to accost The Stranger, whom he saw still lingering there. \'Twas one well known to him in former days, A Shepherd-lad; who ere his sixteenth year Had left that calling, tempted to entrust His expectations to the fickle winds And perilous waters; with the mariners A fellow-mariner;--and so had fared Through twenty seasons; but he had been reared Among the mountains, and he in his heart Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas. Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard The tones of waterfalls, and inland sounds Of caves and trees:--and, when the regular wind Between the tropics filled the steady sail, And blew with the same breath through days and weeks, Lengthening invisibly its weary line Along the cloudless Main, he, in those hours Of tiresome indolence, would often hang Over the vessel\'s side, and gaze and gaze; And, while the broad blue wave and sparkling foam Flashed round him images and hues that wrought In union with the employment of his heart, He, thus by feverish passion overcome, Even with the organs of his bodily eye, Below him, in the bosom of the deep, Saw mountains; saw the forms of sheep that grazed On verdant hills--with dwellings among trees, And shepherds clad in the same country grey Which he himself had worn. And now, at last, From perils manifold, with some small wealth Acquired by traffic \'mid the Indian Isles, To his paternal home he is returned, With a determined purpose to resume The life he had lived there; both for the sake Of many darling pleasures, and the love Which to an only brother he has borne In all his hardships, since that happy time When, whether it blew foul or fair, they two Were brother-shepherds on their native hills. --They were the last of all their race: and now, When Leonard had approached his home, his heart Failed in him; and, not venturing to enquire Tidings of one so long and dearly loved, He to the solitary churchyard turned; That, as he knew in what particular spot His family were laid, he thence might learn If still his Brother lived, or to the file Another grave was added.--He had found Another grave,--near which a full half-hour He had remained; but, as he gazed, there grew Such a confusion in his memory, That he began to doubt; and even to hope That he had seen this heap of turf before,-- That it was not another grave; but one He had forgotten. He had lost his path, As up the vale, that afternoon, he walked Through fields which once had been well known to him: And oh what joy this recollection now Sent to his heart! he lifted up his eyes, And, looking round, imagined that he saw Strange alteration wrought on every side Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks, And everlasting hills themselves were changed. 0 By this the Priest, who down the field had come, Unseen by Leonard, at the churchyard gate Stopped short,--and thence, at leisure, limb by limb Perused him with a gay complacency. Ay, thought the Vicar, smiling to himself, \'Tis one of those who needs must leave the path Of the world\'s business to go wild alone: His arms have a perpetual holiday; The happy man will creep about the fields, Following his fancies by the hour, to bring Tears down his cheek, or solitary smiles Into his face, until the setting sun Write fool upon his forehead.--Planted thus Beneath a shed that over-arched the gate Of this rude churchyard, till the stars appeared The good Man might have communed with himself, But that the Stranger, who had left the grave, Approached; he recognised the Priest at once, And, after greetings interchanged, and given By Leonard to the Vicar as to one Unknown to him, this dialogue ensued. LEONARD. You live, Sir, in these dales, a quiet life: Your years make up one peaceful family; And who would grieve and fret, if, welcome come And welcome gone, they are so like each other, They cannot be remembered? Scarce a funeral Comes to this churchyard once in eighteen months; And yet, some changes must take place among you: And you, who dwell here, even among these rocks, Can trace the finger of mortality, And see, that with our threescore years and ten We are not all that perish.----I remember, (For many years ago I passed this road) There was a foot-way all along the fields By the brook-side--\'tis gone--and that dark cleft! To me it does not seem to wear the face Which then it had! PRIEST. Nay, Sir, for aught I know, That chasm is much the same-- LEONARD. But, surely, yonder-- PRIEST. Ay, there, indeed, your memory is a friend That does not play you false.--On that tall pike (It is the loneliest place of all these hills) There were two springs which bubbled side by side, As if they had been made that they might be Companions for each other: the huge crag Was rent with lightning--one hath disappeared; The other, left behind, is flowing still. For accidents and changes such as these, We want not store of them;--a waterspout Will bring down half a mountain; what a feast For folks that wander up and down like you, To see an acre\'s breadth of that wide cliff One roaring cataract! a sharp May-storm Will come with loads of January snow, And in one night send twenty score of sheep To feed the ravens; or a shepherd dies By some untoward death among the rocks: The ice breaks up and sweeps away a bridge; A wood is felled:--and then for our own homes! A child is born or christened, a field ploughed, A daughter sent to service, a web spun, The old house-clock is decked with a new face; And hence, so far from wanting facts or dates To chronicle the time, we all have here A pair of diaries,--one serving, Sir, For the whole dale, and one for each fireside-- Yours was a stranger\'s judgment: for historians, Commend me to these valleys! LEONARD. Yet your Churchyard Seems, if such freedom may be used with you, To say that you are heedless of the past: An orphan could not find his mother\'s grave: Here\'s neither head nor foot stone, plate of brass, Cross-bones nor skull,--type of our earthly state Nor emblem of our hopes: the dead man\'s home Is but a fellow to that pasture-field. PRIEST. Why, there, Sir, is a thought that\'s new to me! The stone-cutters, \'tis true, might beg their bread If every English churchyard were like ours; Yet your conclusion wanders from the truth: We have no need of names and epitaphs; We talk about the dead by our firesides. And then, for our immortal part! \'we\' want No symbols, Sir, to tell us that plain tale: The thought of death sits easy on the man Who has been born and dies among the mountains. LEONARD. Your Dalesmen, then, do in each other\'s thoughts Possess a kind of second life: no doubt You, Sir, could help me to the history Of half these graves? PRIEST. For eight-score winters past, With what I\'ve witnessed, and with what I\'ve heard, Perhaps I might; and, on a winter-evening, If you were seated at my chimney\'s nook, By turning o\'er these hillocks one by one, We two could travel, Sir, through a strange round; Yet all in the broad highway of the world. Now there\'s a grave--your foot is half upon it,-- It looks just like the rest; and yet that man 0 Died broken-hearted. LEONARD. \'Tis a common case. We\'ll take another: who is he that lies Beneath yon ridge, the last of those three graves? It touches on that piece of native rock Left in the church-yard wall. PRIEST. That\'s Walter Ewbank. He had as white a head and fresh a cheek As ever were produced by youth and age Engendering in the blood of hale fourscore. Through five long generations had the heart Of Walter\'s forefathers o\'erflowed the bounds Of their inheritance, that single cottage-- You see it yonder! and those few green fields. They toiled and wrought, and still, from sire to son, Each struggled, and each yielded as before A little--yet a little,--and old Walter, They left to him the family heart, and land With other burthens than the crop it bore. Year after year the old man still kept up A cheerful mind,--and buffeted with bond, Interest, and mortgages; at last he sank, And went into his grave before his time. Poor Walter! whether it was care that spurred him God only knows, but to the very last He had the lightest foot in Ennerdale: His pace was never that of an old man: I almost see him tripping down the path With his two grandsons after him:--but you, Unless our Landlord be your host tonight, Have far to travel,--and on these rough paths Even in the longest day of midsummer-- LEONARD. But those two Orphans! PRIEST. Orphans!--Such they were-- Yet not while Walter lived: for, though their parents Lay buried side by side as now they lie, The old man was a father to the boys, Two fathers in one father: and if tears, Shed when he talked of them where they were not, And hauntings from the infirmity of love, Are aught of what makes up a mother\'s heart, This old Man, in the day of his old age, Was half a mother to them.--If you weep, Sir, To hear a stranger talking about strangers, Heaven bless you when you are among your kindred! Ay--you may turn that way--it is a grave Which will bear looking at. LEONARD. These boys--I hope They loved this good old Man?-- PRIEST. They did--and truly: But that was what we almost overlooked, They were such darlings of each other. Yes, Though from the cradle they had lived with Walter, The only kinsman near them, and though he Inclined to both by reason of his age, With a more fond, familiar, tenderness; They, notwithstanding, had much love to spare, And it all went into each other\'s hearts. Leonard, the elder by just eighteen months, Was two years taller: \'twas a joy to see, To hear, to meet them!--From their house the school Is distant three short miles, and in the time Of storm and thaw, when every watercourse And unbridged stream, such as you may have noticed Crossing our roads at every hundred steps, Was swoln into a noisy rivulet, Would Leonard then, when eider boys remained At home, go staggering through the slippery fords, Bearing his brother on his back. I have seen him, On windy days, in one of those stray brooks, Ay, more than once I have seen him, midleg deep, Their two books lying both on a dry stone, Upon the hither side: and once I said, As I remember, looking round these rocks And hills on which we all of us were born, That God who made the great book of the world Would bless such piety-- LEONARD. It may be then-- PRIEST. Never did worthier lads break English bread: The very brightest Sunday Autumn saw With all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts, Could never keep those boys away from church, Or tempt them to an hour of sabbath breach. Leonard and James! I warrant, every corner Among these rocks, and every hollow place That venturous foot could reach, to one or both Was known as well as to the flowers that grow there. Like roe-bucks they went bounding o\'er the hills; They played like two young ravens on the crags: Then they could write, ay and speak too, as well As many of their betters--and for Leonard! The very night before he went away, In my own house I put into his hand A Bible, and I\'d wager house and field That, if he be alive, he has it yet. LEONARD. It seems, these Brothers have not lived to be A comfort to each other-- PRIEST. That they might Live to such end is what both old and young In this our valley all of us have wished, 0 And what, for my part, I have often prayed: But Leonard-- LEONARD. Then James still is left among you! PRIEST. \'Tis of the elder brother I am speaking: They had an uncle;--he was at that time A thriving man, and trafficked on the seas: And, but for that same uncle, to this hour Leonard had never handled rope or shroud: For the boy loved the life which we lead here; And though of unripe years, a stripling only, His soul was knit to this his native soil. But, as I said, old Walter was too weak To strive with such a torrent; when he died, The estate and house were sold; and all their sheep, A pretty flock, and which, for aught I know, Had clothed the Ewbanks for a thousand years:-- Well--all was gone, and they were destitute, And Leonard, chiefly for his Brother\'s sake, Resolved to try his fortune on the seas. Twelve years are past since we had tidings from him. If there were one among us who had heard That Leonard Ewbank was come home again, From the Great Gavel, down by Leeza\'s banks, And down the Enna, far as Egremont, The day would be a joyous festival; And those two bells of ours, which there you see-- Hanging in the open air--but, O good Sir! This is sad talk--they\'ll never sound for him-- Living or dead.--When last we heard of him, He was in slavery among the Moors Upon the Barbary coast.--\'Twas not a little That would bring down his spirit; and no doubt, Before it ended in his death, the Youth Was sadly crossed.--Poor Leonard! when we parted, He took me by the hand, and said to me, If e\'er he should grow rich, he would return, To live in peace upon his father\'s land, And any his bones among us. LEONARD. If that day Should come, \'twould needs be a glad day for him; He would himself, no doubt, be happy then As any that should meet him-- PRIEST. Happy! Sir-- LEONARD. You said his kindred all were in their graves, And that he had one Brother-- PRIEST. That is but A fellow-tale of sorrow. From his youth James, though not sickly, yet was delicate; And Leonard being always by his side Had done so many offices about him, That, though he was not of a timid nature, Yet still the spirit of a mountain-boy In him was somewhat checked; and, when his Brother Was gone to sea, and he was left alone, The little colour that he had was soon Stolen from his cheek; he drooped, and pined, and pined-- LEONARD. But these are all the graves of full-grown men! PRIEST. Ay, Sir, that passed away: we took him to us; He was the child of all the dale--he lived Three months with one, and six months with another, And wanted neither food, nor clothes, nor love: And many, many happy days were his. But, whether blithe or sad, \'tis my belief His absent Brother still was at his heart. And, when he dwelt beneath our roof, we found (A practice till this time unknown to him) That often, rising from his bed at night, He in his sleep would walk about, and sleeping He sought his brother Leonard.--You are moved! Forgive me, Sir: before I spoke to you, I judged you most unkindly. LEONARD. But this Youth, How did he die at last? PRIEST. One sweet May-morning, (It will be twelve years since when Spring returns) He had gone forth among the new-dropped lambs, With two or three companions, whom their course Of occupation led from height to height Under a cloudless sun--till he, at length, Through weariness, or, haply, to indulge The humour of the moment, lagged behind. You see yon precipice;--it wears the shape Of a vast building made of many crags; And in the midst is one particular rock That rises like a column from the vale, Whence by our shepherds it is called, THE PILLAR. Upon its aery summit crowned with heath, The loiterer, not unnoticed by his comrades, Lay stretched at ease; but, passing by the place On their return, they found that he was gone. No ill was feared; till one of them by chance Entering, when evening was far spent, the house Which at that time was James\'s home, there learned That nobody had seen him all that day: The morning came, and still he was unheard of: The neighbours were alarmed, and to the brook Some hastened; some ran to the lake: ere noon They found him at the foot of that same rock Dead, and with mangled limbs. The third day after I buried him, poor Youth, and there he lies! 0 LEONARD. And that then \'is\' his grave!--Before his death You say that he saw many happy years? PRIEST. Ay, that he did-- LEONARD. And all went well with him?-- PRIEST. If he had one, the Youth had twenty homes. LEONARD. And you believe, then, that his mind was easy?-- PRIEST. Yes, long before he died, he found that time Is a true friend to sorrow; and unless His thoughts were turned on Leonard\'s luckless fortune, He talked about him with a cheerful love. LEONARD. He could not come to an unhallowed end! PRIEST. Nay, God forbid!--You recollect I mentioned A habit which disquietude and grief Had brought upon him; and we all conjectured That, as the day was warm, he had lain down On the soft heath,--and, waiting for his comrades, He there had fallen asleep; that in his sleep He to the margin of the precipice Had walked, and from the summit had fallen headlong: And so no doubt he perished. When the Youth Fell, in his hand he must have grasped, we think, His shepherd\'s staff; for on that Pillar of rock It had been caught mid-way; and there for years It hung;--and mouldered there. The Priest here ended-- The Stranger would have thanked him, but he felt A gushing from his heart, that took away The power of speech. Both left the spot in silence; And Leonard, when they reached the churchyard gate, As the Priest lifted up the latch, turned round,-- And, looking at the grave, he said, \'My Brother!\' The Vicar did not hear the words: and now, He pointed towards his dwelling-place, entreating That Leonard would partake his homely fare: The other thanked him with an earnest voice; But added, that, the evening being calm, He would pursue his journey. So they parted. It was not long ere Leonard reached a grove That overhung the road: he there stopped short, And, sitting down beneath the trees, reviewed All that the Priest had said: his early years Were with him:--his long absence, cherished hopes, And thoughts which had been his an hour before, All pressed on him with such a weight, that now, This vale, where he had been so happy, seemed A place in which he could not bear to live: So he relinquished all his purposes. He travelled back to Egremont: and thence, That night, he wrote a letter to the Priest, Reminding him of what had passed between them; And adding, with a hope to be forgiven, That it was from the weakness of his heart He had not dared to tell him who he was. This done, he went on shipboard, and is now A Seaman, a grey-headed Mariner.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nArgument For Suicide\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSend this man to the mine, this to the battle, Famish an aged beggar at your gates, And let him die by inches- but for worlds Lift not your hand against him- Live, live on, As if this earth owned neither steel nor arsenic, A rope, a river, or a standing pool. Live, if you dread the pains of hell, or think Your corpse would quarrel with a stake- alas Has misery then no friend?- if you would die By license, call the dropsy and the stone And let them end you- strange it is; And most fantastic are the magic circles Drawn round the thing called life- till we have learned To prize it less, we ne\'er shall learn to prize The things worth living for.-\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Parsonage In Oxfordshire\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWhere holy ground begins, unhallowed ends,Is marked by no distinguishable line;The turf unites, the pathways intertwine;And, wheresoe\'er the stealing footstep tends,Garden, and that domain where kindred, friends,And neighbours rest together, here confoundTheir several features, mingled like the soundOf many waters, or as evening blendsWith shady night.

What is\'t that ails young Harry Gill? That evermore his teeth they chatter, Chatter, chatter, chatter still! Of waistcoats Harry has no lack, Good duffle grey, and flannel fine; He has a blanket on his back, And coats enough to smother nine. In March, December, and in July, \'Tis all the same with Harry Gill; The neighbours tell, and tell you truly, His teeth they chatter, chatter still. At night, at morning, and at noon, \'Tis all the same with Harry Gill; Beneath the sun, beneath the moon, His teeth they chatter, chatter still! Young Harry was a lusty drover, And who so stout of limb as he? His cheeks were red as ruddy clover; His voice was like the voice of three. Old Goody Blake was old and poor; Ill fed she was, and thinly clad; And any man who passed her door Might see how poor a hut she had. All day she spun in her poor dwelling: And then her three hours\' work at night, Alas! \'twas hardly worth the telling, It would not pay for candle-light. Remote from sheltered village-green, On a hill\'s northern side she dwelt, Where from sea-blasts the hawthorns lean, And hoary dews are slow to melt. By the same fire to boil their pottage, Two poor old Dames, as I have known, Will often live in one small cottage; But she, poor Woman! housed alone. \'Twas well enough when summer came, The long, warm, lightsome summer-day, Then at her door the \'canty\' Dame Would sit, as any linnet, gay. But when the ice our streams did fetter, Oh then how her old bones would shake! You would have said, if you had met her, \'Twas a hard time for Goody Blake. Her evenings then were dull and dead: Sad case it was, as you may think, For very cold to go to bed; And then for cold not sleep a wink. O joy for her! whene\'er in winter The winds at night had made a rout; And scattered many a lusty splinter And many a rotten bough about. Yet never had she, well or sick, As every man who knew her says, A pile beforehand, turf or stick, Enough to warm her for three days. Now, when the frost was past enduring, And made her poor old bones to ache, Could any thing be more alluring Than an old hedge to Goody Blake? And, now and then, it must be said, When her old bones were cold and chill, She left her fire, or left her bed, To seek the hedge of Harry Gill. Now Harry he had long suspected This trespass of old Goody Blake; And vowed that she should be detected-- That he on her would vengeance take. And oft from his warm fire he\'d go, And to the fields his road would take; And there, at night, in frost and snow, He watched to seize old Goody Blake. And once, behind a rick of barley, Thus looking out did Harry stand: The moon was full and shining clearly, And crisp with frost the stubble land. --He hears a noise--he\'s all awake-- Again?--on tip-toe down the hill He softly creeps--\'tis Goody Blake; She\'s at the hedge of Harry Gill! Right glad was he when he beheld her: Stick after stick did Goody pull: He stood behind a bush of elder, Till she had filled her apron full. When with her load she turned about, The by-way back again to take; He started forward, with a shout, And sprang upon poor Goody Blake. And fiercely by the arm he took her, And by the arm he held her fast, And fiercely by the arm he shook her, And cried, "I\'ve caught you then at last!"-- Then Goody, who had nothing said, Her bundle from her lap let fall; And, kneeling on the sticks, she prayed To God that is the judge of all. She prayed, her withered hand uprearing, While Harry held her by the arm-- "God! who art never out of hearing, O may he never more be warm!" 0 The cold, cold moon above her head, Thus on her knees did Goody pray; Young Harry heard what she had said: And icy cold he turned away. He went complaining all the morrow That he was cold and very chill: His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow, Alas! that day for Harry Gill! That day he wore a riding-coat, But not a whit the warmer he: Another was on Thursday brought, And ere the Sabbath he had three. \'Twas all in vain, a useless matter, And blankets were about him pinned; Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter; Like a loose casement in the wind. And Harry\'s flesh it fell away; And all who see him say, \'tis plain, That, live as long as live he may, He never will be warm again. No word to any man he utters, A-bed or up, to young or old; But ever to himself he mutters, "Poor Harry Gill is very cold." A-bed or up, by night or day; His teeth they chatter, chatter still. Now think, ye farmers all, I pray, Of Goody Blake and Harry Gill!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLament Of Mary Queen Of Scots\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSMILE of the Moon!---for I so nameThat silent greeting from above;A gentle flash of light that cameFrom her whom drooping captives love;Or art thou of still higher birth?Thou that didst part the clouds of earth,My torpor to reprove!Bright boon of pitying Heaven!---alas,I may not trust thy placid cheer!Pondering that Time tonight will passThe threshold of another year;For years to me are sad and dull;My very moments are too fullOf hopelessness and fear.And yet, the soul-awakening gleam,That struck perchance the farthest coneOf Scotland\'s rocky wilds, did seemTo visit me, and me alone;Me, unapproached by any friend,Save those who to my sorrow lendTears due unto their own.To night the church-tower bells will ringThrough these wide realms a festire peal;To the new year a welcoming;A tuneful offering for the wealOf happy millions lulled in deep;While I am forced to watch and weep,By wounds that may not heal.Born all too high, by wedlock raisedStill higher\\\'97to be cast thus low!Would that mine eyes had never gazedOn aught of more ambitious showThan the sweet flowerets of the fields---It is my royal state that yieldsThis bitterness of woe.Yet how?---for I, if there be truthIn the world\'s voice, was passing fair;And beauty, for confiding youth,Those shocks of passion can prepareThat kill the bloom before its time;And blanch, without the owner\'s crime,The most resplendent hair.Unblest distinction! showered on meTo bind a lingering life in chains:All that could quit my grasp, or flee,Is gone;---but not the subtle stainsFixed in the spirit; for even hereCan I be proud that jealous fearOf what I was remains.A Woman rules my prison\'s key;A sister Queen, against the bentO\\\'a3 law and holiest sympathy,Detains me, doubtful of the event;Great God, who feel\'st for my distress,My thoughts are all that I possess,O keep them innocent!Farewell desire of human aid,Which abject mortals vainly court!By friends deceived, by foes betrayed,Of fears the prey, of hopes the sport;Nought but the world-redeeming CrossIs able to support my loss,My burthen to support.Hark! the death-note of the yearSounded by the castle-clock!From her sunk eyes a stagnant tearStole forth, unsettled by the shock;But oft the woods renewed their green,Ere the tired head of Scotland\'s QueenReposed upon the block!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEllen Irwin\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFair Ellen Irwin, when she sate Upon the braes of Kirtle, Was lovely as a Grecian maid Adorned with wreaths of myrtle; Young Adam Bruce beside her lay, And there did they beguile the day With love and gentle speeches, Beneath the budding beeches. From many knights and many squires The Bruce had been selected; And Gordon, fairest of them all, By Ellen was rejected. Sad tidings to that noble Youth! For it may be proclaimed with truth, If Bruce hath loved sincerely, That Gordon loves as dearly. But what are Gordon\'s form and face, His shattered hopes and crosses, To them, \'mid Kirtle\'s pleasant braes, Reclined on flowers and mosses? Alas that ever he was born! The Gordon, couched behind a thorn, Sees them and their caressing; Beholds them blest and blessing. Proud Gordon, maddened by the thoughts That through his brain are travelling, Rushed forth, and at the heart of Bruce He launched a deadly javelin! Fair Ellen saw it as it came, And, starting up to meet the same, Did with her body cover The Youth, her chosen lover. And, falling into Bruce\'s arms, Thus died the beauteous Ellen, Thus, from the heart of her True-love, The mortal spear repelling. And Bruce, as soon as he had slain The Gordon, sailed away to Spain; And fought with rage incessant Against the Moorish crescent. But many days, and many months, And many years ensuing, This wretched Knight did vainly seek The death that he was wooing. So, coming his last help to crave, Heart-broken, upon Ellen\'s grave His body he extended, And there his sorrow ended. Now ye, who willingly have heard The tale I have been telling, May in Kirkconnel churchyard view The grave of lovely Ellen: By Ellen\'s side the Bruce is laid; And, for the stone upon his head, May no rude hand deface it, And its forlorn "Hie jacet"!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAndrew Jones\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI hate that Andrew Jones; he\'ll breed His children up to waste and pillage. I wish the press-gang or the drum With its tantara sound would come, And sweep him from the village! I said not this, because he loves Through the long day to swear and tipple; But for the poor dear sake of one To whom a foul deed he had done, A friendless man, a travelling cripple! For this poor crawling helpless wretch, Some horseman who was passing by, A penny on the ground had thrown; But the poor cripple was alone And could not stoop--no help was nigh. Inch-thick the dust lay on the ground For it had long been droughty weather; So with his staff the cripple wrought Among the dust till he had brought The half-pennies together. It chanced that Andrew passed that way Just at the time; and there he found The cripple in the mid-day heat Standing alone, and at his feet He saw the penny on the ground. He stopped and took the penny up: And when the cripple nearer drew, Quoth Andrew, "Under half-a-crown, What a man finds is all his own, And so, my Friend, good-day to you." And \'hence\' I said, that Andrew\'s boys Will all be trained to waste and pillage; And wished the press-gang, or the drum With its tantara sound, would come And sweep him from the village.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nRuth\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWhen Ruth was left half desolate, Her Father took another Mate; And Ruth, not seven years old, A slighted child, at her own will Went wandering over dale and hill, In thoughtless freedom, bold. And she had made a pipe of straw, And music from that pipe could draw Like sounds of winds and floods; Had built a bower upon the green, As if she from her birth had been An infant of the woods. Beneath her father\'s roof, alone She seemed to live; her thoughts her own; Herself her own delight; Pleased with herself, nor sad, nor gay; And, passing thus the live-long day, She grew to woman\'s height. There came a Youth from Georgia\'s shore-- A military casque he wore, With splendid feathers drest; He brought them from the Cherokees; The feathers nodded in the breeze, And made a gallant crest. From Indian blood you deem him sprung: But no! he spake the English tongue, And bore a soldier\'s name; And, when America was free From battle and from jeopardy, He \'cross the ocean came. With hues of genius on his cheek In finest tones the Youth could speak: --While he was yet a boy, The moon, the glory of the sun, And streams that murmur as they run, Had been his dearest joy. He was a lovely Youth! I guess The panther in the wilderness Was not so fair as he; And, when he chose to sport and play, No dolphin ever was so gay Upon the tropic sea. Among the Indians he had fought, And with him many tales he brought Of pleasure and of fear; Such tales as told to any maid By such a Youth, in the green shade, Were perilous to hear. He told of girls--a happy rout! Who quit their fold with dance and shout, Their pleasant Indian town, To gather strawberries all day long; Returning with a choral song When daylight is gone down. He spake of plants that hourly change Their blossoms, through a boundless range Of intermingling hues; With budding, fading, faded flowers They stand the wonder of the bowers From morn to evening dews. He told of the magnolia, spread High as a cloud, high over head! The cypress and her spire; --Of flowers that with one scarlet gleam Cover a hundred leagues, and seem To set the hills on fire. The Youth of green savannahs spake, And many an endless, endless lake, With all its fairy crowds Of islands, that together lie As quietly as spots of sky Among the evening clouds. "How pleasant," then he said, "it were A fisher or a hunter there, In sunshine or in shade To wander with an easy mind; And build a household fire, and find A home in every glade! "What days and what bright years! Ah me! Our life were life indeed, with thee So passed in quiet bliss, And all the while," said he, "to know That we were in a world of woe, On such an earth as this!" And then he sometimes interwove Fond thoughts about a father\'s love "For there," said he, "are spun Around the heart such tender ties, That our own children to our eyes Are dearer than the sun. "Sweet Ruth! and could you go with me My helpmate in the woods to be, Our shed at night to rear; Or run, my own adopted bride, A sylvan huntress at my side, And drive the flying deer! "Beloved Ruth!"--No more he said, The wakeful Ruth at midnight shed A solitary tear: She thought again--and did agree 0 With him to sail across the sea, And drive the flying deer. "And now, as fitting is and right, We in the church our faith will plight, A husband and a wife." Even so they did; and I may say That to sweet Ruth that happy day Was more than human life. Through dream and vision did she sink, Delighted all the while to think That on those lonesome floods, And green savannahs, she should share His board with lawful joy, and bear His name in the wild woods. But, as you have before been told, This Stripling, sportive, gay, and bold, And, with his dancing crest, So beautiful, through savage lands Had roamed about, with vagrant bands Of Indians in the West. The wind, the tempest roaring high, The tumult of a tropic sky, Might well be dangerous food For him, a Youth to whom was given So much of earth--so much of heaven, And such impetuous blood. Whatever in those climes he found Irregular in sight or sound Did to his mind impart A kindred impulse, seemed allied To his own powers, and justified The workings of his heart. Nor less, to feed voluptuous thought, The beauteous forms of nature wrought, Fair trees and gorgeous flowers; The breezes their own languor lent; The stars had feelings, which they sent Into those favoured bowers. Yet, in his worst pursuits, I ween That sometimes there did intervene Pure hopes of high intent: For passions linked to forms so fair And stately, needs must have their share Of noble sentiment. But ill he lived, much evil saw, With men to whom no better law Nor better life was known; Deliberately, and undeceived, Those wild men\'s vices he received, And gave them back his own. His genius and his moral frame Were thus impaired, and he became The slave of low desires: A Man who without self-control Would seek what the degraded soul Unworthily admires. And yet he with no feigned delight Had wooed the Maiden, day and night Had loved her, night and morn: What could he less than love a Maid Whose heart with so much nature played? So kind and so forlorn! Sometimes, most earnestly, he said, "O Ruth! I have been worse than dead; False thoughts, thoughts bold and vain, Encompassed me on every side When I, in confidence and pride, Had crossed the Atlantic main. "Before me shone a glorious world-- Fresh as a banner bright, unfurled To music suddenly: I looked upon those hills and plains, And seemed as if let loose from chains, To live at liberty. "No more of this; for now, by thee Dear Ruth! more happily set free With nobler zeal I burn; My soul from darkness is released, Like the whole sky when to the east The morning doth return." Full soon that better mind was gone; No hope, no wish remained, not one,-- They stirred him now no more; New objects did new pleasure give, And once again he wished to live As lawless as before. Meanwhile, as thus with him it fared, They for the voyage were prepared, And went to the sea-shore, But, when they thither came the Youth Deserted his poor Bride, and Ruth Could never find him more. God help thee, Ruth!--Such pains she had, That she in half a year was mad, And in a prison housed; And there, with many a doleful song Made of wild words, her cup of wrong She fearfully caroused. Yet sometimes milder hours she knew, Nor wanted sun, nor rain, nor dew, 0 Nor pastimes of the May; --They all were with her in her cell; And a clear brook with cheerful knell Did o\'er the pebbles play. When Ruth three seasons thus had lain, There came a respite to her pain; She from her prison fled; But of the Vagrant none took thought; And where it liked her best she sought Her shelter and her bread. Among the fields she breathed again: The master-current of her brain Ran permanent and free; And, coming to the Banks of Tone, There did she rest; and dwell alone Under the greenwood tree. The engines of her pain, the tools That shaped her sorrow, rocks and pools, And airs that gently stir The vernal leaves--she loved them still; Nor ever taxed them with the ill Which had been done to her. A Barn her \'winter\' bed supplies; But, till the warmth of summer skies And summer days is gone, (And all do in this tale agree) She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree, And other home hath none. An innocent life, yet far astray! And Ruth will, long before her day, Be broken down and old: Sore aches she needs must have! but less Of mind, than body\'s wretchedness, From damp, and rain, and cold. If she is prest by want of food, She from her dwelling in the wood Repairs to a road-side; And there she begs at one steep place Where up and down with easy pace The horsemen-travellers ride. That oaten pipe of hers is mute, Or thrown away; but with a flute Her loneliness she cheers: This flute, made of a hemlock stalk, At evening in his homeward walk The Quantock woodman hears. I, too, have passed her on the hills Setting her little water-mills By spouts and fountains wild-- Such small machinery as she turned Ere she had wept, ere she had mourned, A young and happy Child! Farewell! and when thy days are told, Ill-fated Ruth, in hallowed mould Thy corpse shall buried be, For thee a funeral bell shall ring, And all the congregation sing A Christian psalm for thee.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nScorn Not The Sonnet\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nScorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned, Mindless of its just honours; with this key Shakspeare unlocked his heart; the melody Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch\'s wound; A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound; With it Camoens soothed an exile\'s grief; The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp, It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew Soul-animating strains--alas, too few!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nResolution And Independence\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIThere was a roaring in the wind all night; The rain came heavily and fell in floods; But now the sun is rising calm and bright; The birds are singing in the distant woods; Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods; The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters; And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.IIAll things that love the sun are out of doors; The sky rejoices in the morning\'s birth; The grass is bright with rain-drops;--on the moors The hare is running races in her mirth; And with her feet she from the plashy earth Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.IIII was a Traveller then upon the moor, I saw the hare that raced about with joy; I heard the woods and distant waters roar; Or heard them not, as happy as a boy: The pleasant season did my heart employ: My old remembrances went from me wholly; And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.IVBut, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might Of joy in minds that can no further go, As high as we have mounted in delight In our dejection do we sink as low; To me that morning did it happen so; And fears and fancies thick upon me came; Dim sadness--and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name. VI heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; And I bethought me of the playful hare: Even such a happy Child of earth am I; Even as these blissful creatures do I fare; Far from the world I walk, and from all care; But there may come another day to me-- Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.VIMy whole life I have lived in pleasant thought, As if life\'s business were a summer mood; As if all needful things would come unsought To genial faith, still rich in genial good; But how can He expect that others should Build for him, sow for him, and at his call Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?VIII thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy, The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; Of Him who walked in glory and in joy Following his plough, along the mountain-side: By our own spirits are we deified: We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.VIIINow, whether it were by peculiar grace, A leading from above, a something given, Yet it befell, that, in this lonely place, When I with these untoward thoughts had striven, Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven I saw a Man before me unawares: The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.IXAs a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie Couched on the bald top of an eminence; Wonder to all who do the same espy, By what means it could thither come, and whence; So that it seems a thing endued with sense: Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;XSuch seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead, Nor all asleep--in his extreme old age: His body was bent double, feet and head Coming together in life\'s pilgrimage; As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage Of sickness felt by him in times long past, A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.XIHimself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: And, still as I drew near with gentle pace, Upon the margin of that moorish flood Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood, That heareth not the loud winds when they call And moveth all together, if it move at all.XIIAt length, himself unsettling, he the pond Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look Upon the muddy water, which he conned, As if he had been reading in a book: And now a stranger\'s privilege I took; And, drawing to his side, to him did say, "This morning gives us promise of a glorious day."XIIIA gentle answer did the old Man make, In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: And him with further words I thus bespake, "What occupation do you there pursue? This is a lonesome place for one like you." Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes,XIVHis words came feebly, from a feeble chest, But each in solemn order followed each, With something of a lofty utterance drest-- Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach Of ordinary men; a stately speech; Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use, Religious men, who give to God and man their dues.XVHe told, that to these waters he had come To gather leeches, being old and poor: Employment hazardous and wearisome! And he had many hardships to endure: From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; Housing, with God\'s good help, by choice or chance, And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.XVIThe old Man still stood talking by my side; But now his voice to me was like a stream Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide; And the whole body of the Man did seem Like one whom I had met with in a dream; Or like a man from some far region sent, To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.XVIIMy former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; And hope that is unwilling to be fed; Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; And mighty Poets in their misery dead. --Perplexed, and longing to be comforted, My question eagerly did I renew, "How is it that you live, and what is it you do?"XVIIIHe with a smile did then his words repeat; And said, that, gathering leeches, far and wide He travelled; stirring thus about his feet The waters of the pools where they abide. "Once I could meet with them on every side; But they have dwindled long by slow decay; Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may."XIXWhile he was talking thus, the lonely place, The old Man\'s shape, and speech--all troubled me: In my mind\'s eye I seemed to see him pace About the weary moors continually, Wandering about alone and silently. While I these thoughts within myself pursued, He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.XXAnd soon with this he other matter blended, Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, But stately in the main; and when he ended, I could have laughed myself to scorn to find In that decrepit Man so firm a mind. "God," said I, "be my help and stay secure; I\'ll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!"\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nElegiac Stanzas\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLulled by the sound of pastoral bells, Rude Nature\'s Pilgrims did we go, From the dread summit of the Queen Of mountains, through a deep ravine, Where, in her holy chapel, dwells "Our Lady of the Snow." The sky was blue, the air was mild; Free were the streams and green the bowers; As if, to rough assaults unknown, The genial spot had \'ever\' shown A countenance that as sweetly smiled-- The face of summer-hours. And we were gay, our hearts at ease; With pleasure dancing through the frame We journeyed; all we knew of care-- Our path that straggled here and there; Of trouble--but the fluttering breeze; Of Winter--but a name. If foresight could have rent the veil Of three short days--but hush--no more! Calm is the grave, and calmer none Than that to which thy cares are gone, Thou Victim of the stormy gale; Asleep on ZURICH\'S shore! O GODDARD! what art thou?--a name-- A sunbeam followed by a shade! Nor more, for aught that time supplies, The great, the experienced, and the wise: Too much from this frail earth we claim, And therefore are betrayed. We met, while festive mirth ran wild, Where, from a deep lake\'s mighty urn, Forth slips, like an enfranchised slave, A sea-green river, proud to lave, With current swift and undefiled, The towers of old LUCERNE. We parted upon solemn ground Far-lifted towards the unfading sky; But all our thoughts were \'then\' of Earth, That gives to common pleasures birth; And nothing in our hearts we found That prompted even a sigh. Fetch, sympathising Powers of air, Fetch, ye that post o\'er seas and lands, Herbs, moistened by Virginian dew, A most untimely grave to strew, Whose turf may never know the care Of \'kindred\' human hands! Beloved by every gentle Muse He left his Transatlantic home: Europe, a realised romance, Had opened on his eager glance; What present bliss!--what golden views! What stores for years to come! Though lodged within no vigorous frame, His soul her daily tasks renewed, Blithe as the lark on sun-gilt wings High poised--or as the wren that sings In shady places, to proclaim Her modest gratitude. Not vain is sadly-uttered praise; The words of truth\'s memorial vow Are sweet as morning fragrance shed From flowers \'mid GOLDAU\'S ruins bred; As evening\'s fondly-lingering rays, On RIGHI\'S silent brow. Lamented Youth! to thy cold clay Fit obsequies the Stranger paid; And piety shall guard the Stone Which hath not left the spot unknown Where the wild waves resigned their prey-- And \'that\' which marks thy bed. And, when thy Mother weeps for Thee, Lost Youth! a solitary Mother; This tribute from a casual Friend A not unwelcome aid may lend, To feed the tender luxury, The rising pang to smother.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFountain, The: A Conversation\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWe talked with open heart, and tongue Affectionate and true, A pair of friends, though I was young, And Matthew seventy-two. We lay beneath a spreading oak, Beside a mossy seat; And from the turf a fountain broke, And gurgled at our feet. "Now, Matthew!" said I, "let us match This water\'s pleasant tune With some old border-song, or catch That suits a summer\'s noon; "Or of the church-clock and the chimes Sing here beneath the shade, That half-mad thing of witty rhymes Which you last April made!" In silence Matthew lay, and eyed The spring beneath the tree; And thus the dear old Man replied, The grey-haired man of glee: "No check, no stay, this Streamlet fears; How merrily it goes! \'Twill murmur on a thousand years, And flow as now it flows. "And here, on this delightful day, I cannot choose but think How oft, a vigorous man, I lay Beside this fountain\'s brink. "My eyes are dim with childish tears, My heart is idly stirred, For the same sound is in my ears Which in those days I heard. "Thus fares it still in our decay: And yet the wiser mind Mourns less for what age takes away Than what it leaves behind. "The blackbird amid leafy trees, The lark above the hill, Let loose their carols when they please Are quiet when they will. "With Nature never do \'they\' wage A foolish strife; they see A happy youth, and their old age Is beautiful and free: "But we are pressed by heavy laws; And often, glad no more, We wear a face of joy, because We have been glad of yore. "If there be one who need bemoan His kindred laid in earth, The household hearts that were his own; It is the man of mirth. "My days, my Friend, are almost gone, My life has been approved, And many love me; but by none Am I enough beloved." "Now both himself and me he wrongs, The man who thus complains; I live and sing my idle songs Upon these happy plains; "And, Matthew, for thy children dead I\'ll be a son to thee!" At this he grasped my hand, and said, "Alas! that cannot be." We rose up from the fountain-side; And down the smooth descent Of the green sheep-track did we glide; And through the wood we went; And, ere we came to Leonard\'s rock, He sang those witty rhymes About the crazy old church-clock, And the bewildered chimes.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAnimal Tranquillity And Decay\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe little hedgerow birds, That peck along the roads, regard him not.

"Myself will to my darling be Both law and impulse: and with me \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The girl, in rock and plain, In earth and heaven, in glade and bower, Shall feel an overseeing power \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86To kindle or restrain. \'She shall be sportive as the fawn That wild with glee across the lawn \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Or up the mountain springs; And hers shall be the breathing balm, And hers the silence and the calm \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Of mute insensate things. \'The floating clouds their state shall lend To her; for her the willow bend; \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Nor shall she fail to see Even in the motions of the storm Grace that shall mould the maiden\'s form \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86By silent sympathy. \'The stars of midnight shall be dear To her; and she shall lean her ear \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86In many a secret place Where rivulets dance their wayward round, And beauty born of murmuring sound \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Shall pass into her face. \'And vital feelings of delight Shall rear her form to stately height, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Her virgin bosom swell; Such thoughts to Lucy I will give While she and I together live \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Here in this happy dell.\' Thus Nature spake--The work was done-- How soon my Lucy\'s race was run! \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86She died, and left to me This heath, this calm, and quiet scene; The memory of what has been, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And never more will be.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLucy Ii\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSHE dwelt among the untrodden ways \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Beside the springs of Dove, A Maid whom there were none to praise \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And very few to love: A violet by a mossy stone \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Half hidden from the eye! Fair as a star, when only one \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Is shining in the sky. She lived unknown, and few could know \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86When Lucy ceased to be; But she is in her grave, and oh, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The difference to me!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nExpostulation And Reply\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n"Why, William, on that old grey stone, Thus for the length of half a day, Why, William, sit you thus alone, And dream your time away? "Where are your books?--that light bequeathed To Beings else forlorn and blind! Up! up! and drink the spirit breathed From dead men to their kind. "You look round on your Mother Earth, As if she for no purpose bore you; As if you were her first-born birth, And none had lived before you!" One morning thus, by Esthwaite lake, When life was sweet, I knew not why, To me my good friend Matthew spake, And thus I made reply: "The eye--it cannot choose but see; We cannot bid the ear be still; Our bodies feel, where\'er they be, Against or with our will. "Nor less I deem that there are Powers Which of themselves our minds impress; That we can feed this mind of ours In a wise passiveness. "Think you, \'mid all this mighty sum Of things for ever speaking, That nothing of itself will come, But we must still be seeking? "--Then ask not wherefore, here, alone, Conversing as I may, I sit upon this old grey stone, And dream my time away,"\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nGuilt And Sorrow\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI A traveller on the skirt of Sarum\'s Plain Pursued his vagrant way, with feet half bare; Stooping his gait, but not as if to gain Help from the staff he bore; for mien and air Were hardy, though his cheek seemed worn with care Both of the time to come, and time long fled: Down fell in straggling locks his thin grey hair; A coat he wore of military red But faded, and stuck o\'er with many a patch and shred. II While thus he journeyed, step by step led on, He saw and passed a stately inn, full sure That welcome in such house for him was none. No board inscribed the needy to allure Hung there, no bush proclaimed to old and poor And desolate, "Here you will find a friend!" The pendent grapes glittered above the door;-- On he must pace, perchance \'till night descend, Where\'er the dreary roads their bare white lines extend. III The gathering clouds grow red with stormy fire, In streaks diverging wide and mounting high; That inn he long had passed; the distant spire, Which oft as he looked back had fixed his eye, Was lost, though still he looked, in the blank sky. Perplexed and comfortless he gazed around, And scarce could any trace of man descry, Save cornfields stretched and stretching without bound; But where the sower dwelt was nowhere to be found. IV No tree was there, no meadow\'s pleasant green, No brook to wet his lip or soothe his ear; Long files of corn-stacks here and there were seen, But not one dwelling-place his heart to cheer. Some labourer, thought he, may perchance be near; And so he sent a feeble shout--in vain; No voice made answer, he could only hear Winds rustling over plots of unripe grain, Or whistling thro\' thin grass along the unfurrowed plain. V Long had he fancied each successive slope Concealed some cottage, whither he might turn And rest; but now along heaven\'s darkening cope The crows rushed by in eddies, homeward borne. Thus warned he sought some shepherd\'s spreading thorn Or hovel from the storm to shield his head, But sought in vain; for now, all wild, forlorn, And vacant, a huge waste around him spread; The wet cold ground, he feared, must be his only bed. VI And be it so--for to the chill night shower And the sharp wind his head he oft hath bared; A Sailor he, who many a wretched hour Hath told; for, landing after labour hard, Full long endured in hope of just reward, He to an armed fleet was forced away By seamen, who perhaps themselves had shared Like fate; was hurried off, a helpless prey, \'Gainst all that in \'his\' heart, or theirs perhaps, said nay. VII For years the work of carnage did not cease, And death\'s dire aspect daily he surveyed, Death\'s minister; then came his glad release, And hope returned, and pleasure fondly made Her dwelling in his dreams. By Fancy\'s aid The happy husband flies, his arms to throw Round his wife\'s neck; the prize of victory laid In her full lap, he sees such sweet tears flow As if thenceforth nor pain nor trouble she could know. VIII Vain hope! for frand took all that he had earned. The lion roars and gluts his tawny brood Even in the desert\'s heart; but he, returned, Bears not to those he loves their needful food. His home approaching, but in such a mood That from his sight his children might have run. He met a traveller, robbed him, shed his blood; And when the miserable work was done He fled, a vagrant since, the murderer\'s fate to shun. IX From that day forth no place to him could be So lonely, but that thence might come a pang Brought from without to inward misery. Now, as he plodded on, with sullen clang A sound of chains along the desert rang; He looked, and saw upon a gibbet high A human body that in irons swang, Uplifted by the tempest whirling by; And, hovering, round it often did a raven fly. X It was a spectacle which none might view, In spot so savage, but with shuddering pain; Nor only did for him at once renew All he had feared from man, but roused a train Of the mind\'s phantoms, horrible as vain. The stones, as if to cover him from day, Rolled at his back along the living plain; He fell, and without sense or motion lay; But, when the trance was gone, feebly pursued his way. XI As one whose brain habitual phrensy fires Owes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed Profounder quiet, when the fit retires, Even so the dire phantasma which had crossed His sense, in sudden vacancy quite lost, Left his mind still as a deep evening stream. Nor, if accosted now, in thought engrossed, Moody, or inly troubled, would he seem To traveller who might talk of any casual theme. XII Hurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled, Gone is the raven timely rest to seek; He seemed the only creature in the wild On whom the elements their rage might wreak; Save that the bustard, of those regions bleak Shy tenant, seeing by the uncertain light A man there wandering, gave a mournful shriek, And half upon the ground, with strange affright, Forced hard against the wind a thick unwieldy flight. XIII All, all was cheerless to the horizon\'s bound; The weary eye--which, wheresoe\'er it strays, Marks nothing but the red sun\'s setting round, Or on the earth strange lines, in former days Left by gigantic arms--at length surveys What seems an antique castle spreading wide; Hoary and naked are its walls, and raise Their brow sublime: in shelter there to bide He turned, while rain poured down smoking on every side. XIV Pile of Stone-henge! so proud to hint yet keep Thy secrets, thou that lov\'st to stand and hear The Plain resounding to the whirlwind\'s sweep, Inmate of lonesome Nature\'s endless year; Even if thou saw\'st the giant wicker rear For sacrifice its throngs of living men, Before thy face did ever wretch appear, Who in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain Than he who, tempest-driven, thy shelter now would gain. XV Within that fabric of mysterious form, Winds met in conflict, each by turns supreme; And, from the perilous ground dislodged, through storm And rain he wildered on, no moon to stream From gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam, Nor any friendly sound his footsteps led; Once did the lightning\'s faint disastrous gleam Disclose a naked guide-post\'s double head, Sight which tho\' lost at once a gleam of pleasure shed. XVI No swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm To stay his steps with faintness overcome; \'Twas dark and void as ocean\'s watery realm Roaring with storms beneath night\'s starless gloom; No gipsy cowered o\'er fire of furze or broom; No labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright, Nor taper glimmered dim from sick man\'s room; Along the waste no line of mournful light From lamp of lonely toll-gate streamed athwart the night. XVII At length, though hid in clouds, the moon arose; The downs were visible--and now revealed A structure stands, which two bare slopes enclose. It was a spot, where, ancient vows fulfilled, Kind pious hands did to the Virgin build A lonely Spital, the belated swain From the night terrors of that waste to shield: But there no human being could remain, And now the walls are named the "Dead House" of the plain. XVIII Though he had little cause to love the abode Of man, or covet sight of mortal face, Yet when faint beams of light that ruin showed, How glad he was at length to find some trace Of human shelter in that dreary place. Till to his flock the early shepherd goes, Here shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace. In a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows He lays his stiffened limbs,--his eyes begin to close; XIX When hearing a deep sigh, that seemed to come From one who mourned in sleep, he raised his head, And saw a woman in the naked room Outstretched, and turning on a restless bed: The moon a wan dead light around her shed. He waked her--spake in tone that would not fail, He hoped, to calm her mind; but ill he sped, For of that ruin she had heard a tale Which now with freezing thoughts did all her powers assail; XX Had heard of one who, forced from storms to shroud, Felt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat Rock to incessant neighings shrill and loud, While his horse pawed the floor with furious heat; Till on a stone, that sparkled to his feet, Struck, and still struck again, the troubled horse: The man half raised the stone with pain and sweat, Half raised, for well his arm might lose its force Disclosing the grim head of a late murdered corse. XXI Such tale of this lone mansion she had learned And, when that shape, with eyes in sleep half drowned, By the moon\'s sullen lamp she first discerned, Cold stony horror all her senses bound. Her he addressed in words of cheering sound; Recovering heart, like answer did she make; And well it was that, of the corse there found, In converse that ensued she nothing spake; She knew not what dire pangs in him such tale could wake. XXII But soon his voice and words of kind intent Banished that dismal thought; and now the wind In fainter howlings told its \'rage\' was spent: Meanwhile discourse ensued of various kind, Which by degrees a confidence of mind And mutual interest failed not to create. And, to a natural sympathy resigned, In that forsaken building where they sate The Woman thus retraced her own untoward fate. XXIII "By Derwent\'s side my father dwelt--a man Of virtuous life, by pious parents bred; And I believe that, soon as I began To lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed, And in his hearing there my prayers I said: And afterwards, by my good father taught, I read, and loved the books in which I read; For books in every neighbouring house I sought, And nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought. XXIV "A little croft we owned--a plot of corn, A garden stored with peas, and mint, and thyme, And flowers for posies, oft on Sunday morn Plucked while the church bells rang their earliest chime. Can I forget our freaks at shearing time! My hen\'s rich nest through long grass scarce espied; The cowslip-gathering in June\'s dewy prime; The swans that with white chests upreared in pride Rushing and racing came to meet me at the water-side. XXV "The staff I well remember which upbore The bending body of my active sire; His seat beneath the honied sycamore Where the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire; When market-morning came, the neat attire With which, though bent on haste, myself I decked; Our watchful house-dog, that would tease and tire The stranger till its barking-fit I checked; The red-breast, known for years, which at my casement pecked. XXVI "The suns of twenty summers danced along,-- Too little marked how fast they rolled away: But, through severe mischance and cruel wrong, My father\'s substance fell into decay: We toiled and struggled, hoping for a day When Fortune might put on a kinder look; But vain were wishes, efforts vain as they; He from his old hereditary nook Must part; the summons came;--our final leave we took. XXVII "It was indeed a miserable hour When, from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed, Peering above the trees, the steeple tower That on his marriage day sweet music made! Tilt then, he hoped his bones might there be laid Close by my mother in their native bowers: Bidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed;-- I could not pray:--through tears that fell in showers Glimmered our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours! XXVIII "There was a Youth whom I had loved so long, That when I loved him not I cannot say: \'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song We two had sung, like gladsome birds in May; When we began to tire of childish play, We seemed still more and more to prize each other; We talked of marriage and our marriage day; And I in truth did love him like a brother, For never could I hope to meet with such another. XXIX "Two years were passed since to a distant town He had repaired to ply a gainful trade: What tears of bitter grief, till then unknown! What tender vows, our last sad kiss delayed! To him we turned:--we had no other aid: Like one revived, upon his neck I wept; And her whom he had loved in joy, he said, He well could love in grief; his faith he kept; And in a quiet home once more my father slept. XXX "We lived in peace and comfort; and were blest With daily bread, by constant toil supplied. Three lovely babes had lain upon my breast; And often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed, And knew not why. My happy father died, When threatened war reduced the children\'s meal: Thrice happy! that for him the grave could hide The empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel, And tears that flowed for ills which patience might not heal. XXXI "\'Twas a hard change; an evil time was come; We had no hope, and no relief could gain: But soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum Beat round to clear the streets of want and pain. My husband\'s arms now only served to strain Me and his children hungering in his view; In such dismay my prayers and tears were vain: To join those miserable men he flew, And now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew. XXXII "There were we long neglected, and we bore Much sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed; Green fields before us, and our native shore, We breathed a pestilential air, that made Ravage for which no knell was heard. We prayed For our departure; wished and wished--nor knew, \'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed, That happier days we never more must view. The parting signal streamed--at last the land withdrew. XXXIII "But the calm summer season now was past. On as we drove, the equinoctial deep Ran mountains high before the howling blast, And many perished in the whirlwind\'s sweep. We gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep, Untaught that soon such anguish must ensue, Our hopes such harvest of affliction reap, That we the mercy of the waves should rue: We reached the western world, a poor devoted crew. XXXIV "The pains and plagues that on our heads came down, Disease and famine, agony and fear, In wood or wilderness, in camp or town, It would unman the firmest heart to hear. All perished--all in one remorseless year, Husband and children! one by one, by sword And ravenous plague, all perished: every tear Dried up, despairing, desolate, on board A British ship I waked, as from a trance restored." XXXV Here paused she of all present thought forlorn, Nor voice nor sound, that moment\'s pain expressed, Yet Nature, with excess of grief o\'erborne, From her full eyes their watery load released. He too was mute; and, ere her weeping ceased, He rose, and to the ruin\'s portal went, And saw the dawn opening the silvery east With rays of promise, north and southward sent; And soon with crimson fire kindled the firmament. XXXVI "O come," he cried, "come, after weary night Of such rough storm, this happy change to view." So forth she came, and eastward looked; the sight Over her brow like dawn of gladness threw; Upon her cheek, to which its youthful hue Seemed to return, dried the last lingering tear, And from her grateful heart a fresh one drew: The whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer Tempered fit words of hope; and the lark warbled near. XXXVII They looked and saw a lengthening road, and wain That rang down a bare slope not far remote: The barrows glistered bright with drops of rain, Whistled the waggoner with merry note, The cock far off sounded his clarion throat; But town, or farm, or hamlet, none they viewed, Only were told there stood a lonely cot A long mile thence. While thither they pursued Their way, the Woman thus her mournful tale renewed. XXXVIII "Peaceful as this immeasurable plain Is now, by beams of dawning light imprest, In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main; The very ocean hath its hour of rest. I too forgot the heavings of my breast. How quiet \'round me ship and ocean were! As quiet all within me. I was blest, And looked, and fed upon the silent air Until it seemed to bring a joy to my despair. XXXIX "Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps, And groans that rage of racking famine spoke; The unburied dead that lay in festering heaps, The breathing pestilence that rose like smoke, The shriek that from the distant battle broke, The mine\'s dire earthquake, and the pallid host Driven by the bomb\'s incessant thunderstroke To loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish tossed, Hope died, and fear itself in agony was lost! XL "Some mighty gulf of separation past, I seemed transported to another world; A thought resigned with pain, when from the mast The impatient mariner the sail unfurled, And, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled The silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home And from all hope I was for ever hurled. For me--farthest from earthly port to roam Was best, could I but shun the spot where man might come. XLI "And oft I thought (my fancy was so strong) That I, at last, a resting-place had found; \'Here will I dwell,\' said I, \'my whole life long, Roaming the illimitable waters round; Here will I live, of all but heaven disowned, And end my days upon the peaceful flood.\'-- To break my dream the vessel reached its bound; And homeless near a thousand homes I stood, And near a thousand tables pined and wanted food. XLII "No help I sought; in sorrow turned adrift, Was hopeless, as if cast on some bare rock; Nor morsel to my mouth that day did lift, Nor raised my hand at any door to knock. I lay where, with his drowsy mates, the cock From the cross-timber of an out-house hung: Dismally tolled, that night, the city clock! At morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung, Nor to the beggar\'s language could I fit my tongue. XLIII "So passed a second day; and, when the third Was come, I tried in vain the crowd\'s resort. --In deep despair, by frightful wishes stirred, Near the sea-side I reached a ruined fort; There, pains which nature could no more support, With blindness linked, did on my vitals fall; And, after many interruptions short Of hideous sense, I sank, nor step could crawl: Unsought for was the help that did my life recall. XLIV "Borne to a hospital, I lay with brain Drowsy and weak, and shattered memory; I heard my neighbours in their beds complain Of many things which never troubled me-- Of feet still bustling round with busy glee, Of looks where common kindness had no part, Of service done with cold formality, Fretting the fever round the languid heart, And groans which, as they said, might make a dead man start. XLV "These things just served to stir the slumbering sense, Nor pain nor pity in my bosom raised. With strength did memory return; and, thence Dismissed, again on open day I gazed, At houses, men, and common light, amazed. The lanes I sought, and, as the sun retired, Came where beneath the trees a faggot blazed, The travellers saw me weep, my fate inquired, And gave me food--and rest, more welcome, more desired. XLVI "Rough potters seemed they, trading soberly With panniered asses driven from door to door; But life of happier sort set forth to me, And other joys my fancy to allure-- The bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor In barn uplighted; and companions boon, Well met from far with revelry secure Among the forest glades, while jocund June Rolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon. XLVII "But ill they suited me--those journeys dark O\'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch! To charm the surly house-dog\'s faithful bark, Or hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch. The gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match, The black disguise, the warning whistle shrill, And ear still busy on its nightly watch, Were not for me, brought up in nothing ill: Besides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still. XLVIII "What could I do, unaided and unblest? My father! gone was every friend of thine: And kindred of dead husband are at best Small help; and, after marriage such as mine, With little kindness would to me incline. Nor was I then for toil or service fit; My deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine; In open air forgetful would I sit Whole hours, with idle arms in moping sorrow knit. XLIX "The roads I paced, I loitered through the fields; Contentedly, yet sometimes self-accused. Trusted my life to what chance bounty yields, Now coldly given, now utterly refused. The ground I for my bed have often used: But what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth, Is that I have my inner self abused, Foregone the home delight of constant truth, And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth. L "Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed, Through tears have seen him towards that world descend Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude: Three years a wanderer now my course I bend-- Oh! tell me whither--for no earthly friend Have I."--She ceased, and weeping turned away; As if because her tale was at an end, She wept; because she had no more to say Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay. LI True sympathy the Sailor\'s looks expressed, His looks--for pondering he was mute the while. Of social Order\'s care for wretchedness, Of Time\'s sure help to calm and reconcile, Joy\'s second spring and Hope\'s long-treasured smile, \'Twas not for \'him\' to speak--a man so tried, Yet, to relieve her heart, in friendly style Proverbial words of comfort he applied, And not in vain, while they went pacing side by side. LII Ere long, from heaps of turf, before their sight, Together smoking in the sun\'s slant beam, Rise various wreaths that into one unite Which high and higher mounts with silver gleam: Fair spectacle,---but instantly a scream Thence bursting shrill did all remark prevent; They paused, and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme, And female cries. Their course they thither bent, And met a man who foamed with anger vehement, LIII A woman stood with quivering lips and pale, And, pointing to a little child that lay Stretched on the ground, began a piteous tale; How in a simple freak of thoughtless play He had provoked his father, who straightway, As if each blow were deadlier than the last, Struck the poor innocent. Pallid with dismay The Soldier\'s Widow heard and stood aghast; And stern looks on the man her grey-haired Comrade cast. LIV His voice with indignation rising high Such further deed in manhood\'s name forbade; The peasant, wild in passion, made reply With bitter insult and revilings sad; Asked him in scorn what business there he had; What kind of plunder he was hunting now; The gallows would one day of him be glad;-- Though inward anguish damped the Sailor\'s brow, Yet calm he seemed as thoughts so poignant would allow. LV Softly he stroked the child, who lay outstretched With face to earth; and, as the boy turned round His battered head, a groan the Sailor fetched As if he saw--there and upon that ground-- Strange repetition of the deadly wound He had himself inflicted. Through his brain At once the griding iron passage found; Deluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain, Nor could his sunken eyes the starting tear restrain. LVI Within himself he said--What hearts have we! The blessing this a father gives his child! Yet happy thou, poor boy! compared with me, Suffering not doing ill--fate far more mild. The stranger\'s looks and tears of wrath beguiled The father, and relenting thoughts awoke; He kissed his son--so all was reconciled. Then, with a voice which inward trouble broke Ere to his lips it came, the Sailor them bespoke. LVII "Bad is the world, and hard is the world\'s law Even for the man who wears the warmest fleece; Much need have ye that time more closely draw The bond of nature, all unkindness cease, And that among so few there still be peace: Else can ye hope but with such numerous foes Your pains shall ever with your years increase?"-- While from his heart the appropriate lesson flows, A correspondent calm stole gently o\'er his woes. LVIII Forthwith the pair passed on; and down they look Into a narrow valley\'s pleasant scene Where wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook, That babbled on through groves and meadows green; A low-roofed house peeped out the trees between; The dripping groves resound with cheerful lays, And melancholy lowings intervene Of scattered herds, that in the meadow graze, Some amid lingering shade, some touched by the sun\'s rays. LIX They saw and heard, and, winding with the road, Down a thick wood, they dropt into the vale; Comfort, by prouder mansions unbestowed, Their wearied frames, she hoped, would soon regale. Erelong they reached that cottage in the dale: It was a rustic inn;--the board was spread, The milk-maid followed with her brimming pail, And lustily the master carved the bread, Kindly the housewife pressed, and they in comfort fed. LX Their breakfast done, the pair, though loth, must part; Wanderers whose course no longer now agrees. She rose and bade farewell! and, while her heart Struggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease, She left him there; for, clustering round his knees, With his oak-staff the cottage children played; And soon she reached a spot o\'erhung with trees And banks of ragged earth; beneath the shade Across the pebbly road a little runnel strayed. LXI A cart and horse beside the rivulet stood; Chequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone. She saw the carman bend to scoop the flood As the wain fronted her,--wherein lay one, A pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone. The carman wet her lips as well behoved; Bed under her lean body there was none, Though even to die near one she most had loved She could not of herself those wasted limbs have moved. LXII The Soldier\'s Widow learned with honest pain And homefelt force of sympathy sincere, Why thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain The jolting road and morning air severe. The wain pursued its way; and following near In pure compassion she her steps retraced Far as the cottage. "A sad sight is here," She cried aloud; and forth ran out in haste The friends whom she had left but a few minutes past. LXIII While to the door with eager speed they ran, From her bare straw the Woman half upraised Her bony visage--gaunt and deadly wan; No pity asking, on the group she gazed With a dim eye, distracted and amazed; Then sank upon her straw with feeble moan. Fervently cried the housewife--"God be praised, I have a house that I can call my own; Nor shall she perish there, untended and alone!" LXIV So in they bear her to the chimney seat, And busily, though yet with fear, untie Her garments, and, to warm her icy feet And chafe her temples, careful hands apply. Nature reviving, with a deep-drawn sigh She strove, and not in vain, her head to rear; Then said--"I thank you all; if I must die, The God in heaven my prayers for you will hear; Till now I did not think my end had been so near. LXV "Barred every comfort labour could procure, Suffering what no endurance could assuage, I was compelled to seek my father\'s door, Though loth to be a burthen on his age. But sickness stopped me in an early stage Of my sad journey; and within the wain They placed me--there to end life\'s pilgrimage, Unless beneath your roof I may remain; For I shall never see my father\'s door again. LXVI "My life, Heaven knows, hath long been burthensome; But, if I have not meekly suffered, meek May my end be! Soon will this voice be dumb: Should child of mine e\'er wander hither, speak Of me, say that the worm is on my cheek.-- Torn from our hut, that stood beside the sea Near Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek, My husband served in sad captivity On shipboard, bound till peace or death should set him free. LXVII "A sailor\'s wife I knew a widow\'s cares, Yet two sweet little ones partook my bed; Hope cheered my dreams, and to my daily prayers Our heavenly Father granted each day\'s bread; Till one was found by stroke of violence dead, Whose body near our cottage chanced to lie; A dire suspicion drove us from our shed; In vain to find a friendly face we try, Nor could we live together those poor boys and I; LXVIII "For evil tongues made oath how on that day My husband lurked about the neighbourhood; Now he had fled, and whither none could say, And \'he\' had done the deed in the dark wood-- Near his own home!--but he was mild and good; Never on earth was gentler creature seen; He\'d not have robbed the raven of its food. My husband\'s lovingkindness stood between Me and all worldly harms and wrongs however keen." LXIX Alas! the thing she told with labouring breath The Sailor knew too well. That wickedness His hand had wrought; and when, in the hour of death, He saw his Wife\'s lips move his name to bless With her last words, unable to suppress His anguish, with his heart he ceased to strive; And, weeping loud in this extreme distress, He cried--"Do pity me! That thou shouldst live I neither ask nor wish--forgive me, but forgive!" LXX To tell the change that Voice within her wrought Nature by sign or sound made no essay; A sudden joy surprised expiring thought, And every mortal pang dissolved away. Borne gently to a bed, in death she lay; Yet still while over her the husband bent, A look was in her face which seemed to say, "Be blest; by sight of thee from heaven was sent Peace to my parting soul, the fulness of content." LXXI \'She\' slept in peace,--his pulses throbbed and stopped, Breathless he gazed upon her face,--then took Her hand in his, and raised it, but both dropped, When on his own he cast a rueful look. His ears were never silent; sleep forsook His burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead; All night from time to time under him shook The floor as he lay shuddering on his bed; And oft he groaned aloud, "O God, that I were dead!" LXXII The Soldier\'s Widow lingered in the cot, And, when he rose, he thanked her pious care Through which his Wife, to that kind shelter brought, Died in his arms; and with those thanks a prayer He breathed for her, and for that merciful pair. The corse interred, not one hour heremained Beneath their roof, but to the open air A burthen, now with fortitude sustained, He bore within a breast where dreadful quiet reigned. LXXIII Confirmed of purpose, fearlessly prepared For act and suffering, to the city straight He journeyed, and forthwith his crime declared: "And from your doom," he added, "now I wait, Nor let it linger long, the murderer\'s fate." Not ineffectual was that piteous claim: "O welcome sentence which will end though late," He said, "the pangs that to my conscience came Out of that deed. My trust, Saviour! is in thy name!" LXXIV His fate was pitied. Him in iron case (Reader, forgive the intolerable thought) They hung not:--no one on \'his\' form or face Could gaze, as on a show by idlers sought; No kindred sufferer, to his death-place brought By lawless curiosity or chance, When into storm the evening sky is wrought, Upon his swinging corse an eye can glance, And drop, as he once dropped, in miserable trance.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPersonal Talk\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nII AM not One who much or oft delightTo season my fireside with personal talk.--Of friends, who live within an easy walk,Or neighbours, daily, weekly, in my sight:And, for my chance-acquaintance, ladies bright,Sons, mothers, maidens withering on the stalk,These all wear out of me, like Forms, with chalkPainted on rich men\'s floors, for one feast-night.Better than such discourse doth silence long,Long, barren silence, square with my desire;To sit without emotion, hope, or aim,In the loved presence of my cottage-fire,And listen to the flapping of the flame,Or kettle whispering its faint undersong.II\'Yet life,\' you say, \'is life; we have seen and see,And with a living pleasure we describe;And fits of sprightly malice do but bribeThe languid mind into activity.Sound sense, and love itself, and mirth and gleeAre fostered by the comment and the gibe.\'Even be it so; yet still among your tribe,Our daily world\'s true Worldlings, rank not me!Children are blest, and powerful; their world liesMore justly balanced; partly at their feet,And part far from them: sweetest melodiesAre those that are by distance made more sweet;Whose mind is but the mind of his own eyes,He is a Slave; the meanest we can meet!IIIWings have we,--and as far as we can go,We may find pleasure: wilderness and wood,Blank ocean and mere sky, support that moodWhich with the lofty sanctifies the low.Dreams, books, are each a world; and books, we know,Are a substantial world, both pure and good:Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,Our pastime and our happiness will grow.There find I personal themes, a plenteous store,Matter wherein right voluble I am,To which I listen with a ready ear;Two shall be named, pre-eminently dear,--The gentle Lady married to the Moor;And heavenly Una with her milk-white Lamb,IVNor can I not believe but that herebyGreat gains are mine; for thus I live remoteFrom evil-speaking; rancour, never sought,Comes to me not; malignant truth, or lie.Hence have I genial seasons, hence have ISmooth passions, smooth discourse, and joyous thought:And thus from day to day my little boatRocks in its harbour, lodging peaceably.Blessings be with them--and eternal praise,Who gave us nobler loves, and nobler cares--The Poets, who on earth have made us heirsOf truth and pure delight by heavenly lays!Oh! might my name be numbered among theirs,Then gladly would I end my mortal days.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDion\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.  See Plutarch.    Serene, and fitted to embrace,   Where\'er he turned, a swan-like grace   Of haughtiness without pretence,   And to unfold a still magnificence,   Was princely Dion, in the power   And beauty of his happier hour.   And what pure homage then did wait   On Dion\'s virtues, while the lunar beam   Of Plato\'s genius, from its lofty sphere,  Fell round him in the grove of Academe,  Softening their inbred dignity austere--    That he, not too elate    With self-sufficing solitude,  But with majestic lowliness endued,  Might in the universal bosom reign,  And from affectionate observance gain  Help, under every change of adverse fate.   Five thousand warriors--O the rapturous day!  Each crowned with flowers, and armed with spear and shield,  Or ruder weapon which their course might yield,  To Syracuse advance in bright array.  Who leads them on?--The anxious people see  Long-exiled Dion marching at their head,  He also crowned with flowers of Sicily,  And in a white, far-beaming, corslet clad!  Pure transport undisturbed by doubt or fear  The gazers feel; and, rushing to the plain,  Salute those strangers as a holy train  Or blest procession (to the Immortals dear)  That brought their precious liberty again.  Lo! when the gates are entered, on each hand,  Down the long street, rich goblets filled with wine    In seemly order stand,  On tables set, as if for rites divine;--  And, as the great Deliverer marches by,  He looks on festal ground with fruits bestrown;  And flowers are on his person thrown    In boundless prodigality;  Nor doth the general voice abstain from prayer,  Invoking Dion\'s tutelary care,  As if a very Deity he were!   Mourn, hills and groves of Attica! and mourn,  Ilissus, bending o\'er thy classic urn!  Mourn, and lament for him whose spirit dreads  Your once sweet memory, studious walks and shades!  For him who to divinity aspired,  Not on the breath of popular applause,  But through dependence on the sacred laws  Framed in the schools where Wisdom dwelt retired,  Intent to trace the ideal path of right  (More fair than heaven\'s broad causeway paved with stars)  Which Dion learned to measure with sublime delight;--  But He hath overleaped the eternal bars;  And, following guides whose craft holds no consent  With aught that breathes the ethereal element,  Hath stained the robes of civil power with blood,  Unjustly shed, though for the public good.  Whence doubts that came too late, and wishes vain,  Hollow excuses, and triumphant pain;  And oft his cogitations sink as low  As, through the abysses of a joyless heart,  The heaviest plummet of despair can go--  But whence that sudden check? that fearful start!    He hears an uncouth sound--    Anon his lifted eyes  Saw, at a long-drawn gallery\'s dusky bound,  A Shape of more than mortal size  And hideous aspect, stalking round and round!    A woman\'s garb the Phantom wore,    And fiercely swept the marble floor,--    Like Auster whirling to and fro,    His force on Caspian foam to try;  Or Boreas when he scours the snow  That skims the plains of Thessaly,  Or when aloft on M\\\'canalus he stops  His flight, \'mid eddying pine-tree tops!   So, but from toil less sign of profit reaping,  The sullen Spectre to her purpose bowed,  Sweeping--vehemently sweeping--  No pause admitted, no design avowed!  "Avaunt, inexplicable Guest!--avaunt,"  Exclaimed the Chieftain--"let me rather see  The coronal that coiling vipers make;  The torch that flames with many a lurid flake,  And the long train of doleful pageantry  Which they behold, whom vengeful Furies haunt;  Who, while they struggle from the scourge to flee,  Move where the blasted soil is not unworn,  And, in their anguish, bear what other minds have borne!"   But Shapes, that come not at an earthly call,  Will not depart when mortal voices bid;  Lords of the visionary eye whose lid,  Once raised, remains aghast, and will not fall!  Ye Gods, thought He, that servile Implement    Obeys a mystical intent!  Your Minister would brush away  The spots that to my soul adhere;  But should she labour night and day,  They will not, cannot disappear;  Whence angry perturbations,--and that look  Which no philosophy can brook!   Ill-fated Chief! there are whose hopes are built  Upon the ruins of thy glorious name;  Who, through the portal of one moment\'s guilt,  Pursue thee with their deadly aim!  O matchless perfidy! portentous lust  Of monstrous crime!--that horror-striking blade,  Drawn in defiance of the Gods, hath laid  The noble Syracusan low in dust!  Shudder\'d the walls--the marble city wept--  And sylvan places heaved a pensive sigh;  But in calm peace the appointed Victim slept,  As he had fallen in magnanimity;  Of spirit too capacious to require  That Destiny her course should change; too just  To his own native greatness to desire  That wretched boon, days lengthened by mistrust.  So were the hopeless troubles, that involved  The soul of Dion, instantly dissolved.  Released from life and cares of princely state,  He left this moral grafted on his Fate;  "Him only pleasure leads, and peace attends,  Him, only him, the shield of Jove defends,  Whose means are fair and spotless as his ends."\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI Travelled Among Unknown Men\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI travelled among unknown menIn lands beyond the sea;Nor, England! did I know till thenWhat love I bore to thee.\'Tis past, that melancholy dream!Nor will I quit thy shoreA second time; for still I seemTo love thee more and more.Among thy mountains did I feelThe joy of my desire;And she I cherished turned her wheelBeside an English fire.Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,The bowers where Lucy played;And thine too is the last green fieldThat Lucy\'s eyes surveyed.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nShe Was A Phantom Of Delight\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nShe was a phantom of delightWhen first she gleamed upon my sight;A lovely Apparition, sentTo be a moment\'s ornament;Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;Like Twilight\'s, too, her dusky hair;But all things else about her drawnFrom May-time and the cheerful Dawn;A dancing Shape, an Image gay,To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.I saw her upon a nearer view,A Spirit, yet a Woman too!Her household motions light and free,And steps of virgin liberty;A countenance in which did meetSweet records, promises as sweet;A Creature not too bright or goodFor human nature\'s daily food;For transient sorrows, simple wiles,Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles.And now I see with eye sereneThe very pulse of the machine;A Being breathing thoughtful breath,A Traveler between life and death;The reason firm, the temperate will,Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;A perfect Woman, nobly planned,To warm, to comfort, and command;And yet a Spirit still, and bright,With something of angelic light.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLucy I\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSTRANGE fits of passion have I known: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And I will dare to tell, But in the lover\'s ear alone, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86What once to me befell. When she I loved look\'d every day \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Fresh as a rose in June, I to her cottage bent my way, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Beneath an evening moon. Upon the moon I fix\'d my eye, All over the wide lea; With quickening pace my horse drew nigh Those paths so dear to me. And now we reach\'d the orchard-plot; And, as we climb\'d the hill, The sinking moon to Lucy\'s cot Came near and nearer still. In one of those sweet dreams I slept, Kind Nature\'s gentlest boon! And all the while my eyes I kept On the descending moon. My horse moved on; hoof after hoof He raised, and never stopp\'d: When down behind the cottage roof, At once, the bright moon dropp\'d. What fond and wayward thoughts will slide Into a lover\'s head! \'O mercy!\' to myself I cried, \'If Lucy should be dead!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Fact, And An Imagination, Or, Canute And Alfred, On The Seashore\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTHE Danish Conqueror, on his royal chair,Mustering a face of haughty sovereignty,To aid a covert purpose, cried--\'O yeApproaching Waters of the deep, that shareWith this green isle my fortunes, come not whereYour Master\'s throne is set.\'--Deaf was the Sea;Her waves rolled on, respecting his decreeLess than they heed a breath of wanton air.--Then Canute, rising from the invaded throne,Said to his servile Courtiers,--\'Poor the reach, The undisguised extent, of mortal sway!He only is a King, and he aloneDeserves the name (this truth the billows preach)Whose everlasting laws, sea, earth, and heaven, obey.\'This just reproof the prosperous DaneDrew, from the influx of the main,For some whose rugged northern mouths would strainAt oriental flattery;And Canute (fact more worthy to be known)From that time forth did for his brows disown The ostentatious symbol of a crown;Esteeming earthly royaltyContemptible as vain.Now hear what one of elder days,Rich theme of England\'s fondest praise,Her darling Alfred, \'might\' have spoken;To cheer the remnant of his hostWhen he was driven from coast to coast,Distressed and harassed, but with mind unbroken:\'My faithful followers, lo! the tide is spent That rose, and steadily advanced to fillThe shores and channels, working Nature\'s willAmong the mazy streams that backward went,And in the sluggish pools where ships are pent:And now, his task performed, the flood stands still,At the green base of many an inland hill,In placid beauty and sublime content!Such the repose that sage and hero find;Such measured rest the sedulous and goodOf humbler name; whose souls do, like the flood Of Ocean, press right on; or gently wind,Neither to be diverted nor withstood,Until they reach the bounds by Heaven assigned.\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nO Nightingale! Thou Surely Art\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nO Nightingale! thou surely artA creature of a "fiery heart":--These notes of thine--they pierce and pierce;Tumultuous harmony and fierce!Thou sing\'st as if the God of wineHad helped thee to a Valentine;A song in mockery and despiteOf shades, and dews, and silent night;And steady bliss, and all the lovesNow sleeping in these peaceful groves. I heard a Stock-dove sing or sayHis homely tale, this very day;His voice was buried among trees,Yet to be come at by the breeze:He did not cease; but cooed--and cooed;And somewhat pensively he wooed:He sang of love, with quiet blending,Slow to begin, and never ending;Of serious faith, and inward glee;That was the song -- the song for me!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAddress To The Scholars Of The Village School Of ----\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI come, ye little noisy Crew, Not long your pastime to prevent; I heard the blessing which to you Our common Friend and Father sent. I kissed his cheek before he died; And when his breath was fled, I raised, while kneeling by his side, His hand:--it dropped like lead. Your hands, dear Little-ones, do all That can be done, will never fall Like his till they are dead. By night or day blow foul or fair, Ne\'er will the best of all your train Play with the locks of his white hair, Or stand between his knees again. Here did he sit confined for hours; But he could see the woods and plains, Could hear the wind and mark the showers Come streaming down the streaming panes. Now stretched beneath his grass-green mound He rests a prisoner of the ground. He loved the breathing air, He loved the sun, but if it rise Or set, to him where now he lies, Brings not a moment\'s care. Alas! what idle words; but take The Dirge which for our Master\'s sake And yours, love prompted me to make. The rhymes so homely in attire With learned ears may ill agree, But chanted by your Orphan Quire Will make a touching melody. DIRGE Mourn, Shepherd, near thy old grey stone; Thou Angler, by the silent flood; And mourn when thou art all alone, Thou Woodman, in the distant wood! Thou one blind Sailor, rich in joy Though blind, thy tunes in sadness hum; And mourn, thou poor half-witted Boy! Born deaf, and living deaf and dumb. Thou drooping sick Man, bless the Guide Who checked or turned thy headstrong youth, As he before had sanctified Thy infancy with heavenly truth. Ye Striplings, light of heart and gay, Bold settlers on some foreign shore, Give, when your thoughts are turned this way, A sigh to him whom we deplore. For us who here in funeral strain With one accord our voices raise, Let sorrow overcharged with pain Be lost in thankfulness and praise. And when our hearts shall feel a sting From ill we meet or good we miss, May touches of his memory bring Fond healing, like a mother\'s kiss. BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER LONG time his pulse hath ceased to beat But benefits, his gift, we trace-- Expressed in every eye we meet Round this dear Vale, his native place. To stately Hall and Cottage rude Flowed from his life what still they hold, Light pleasures, every day, renewed; And blessings half a century old. Oh true of heart, of spirit gay, Thy faults, where not already gone From memory, prolong their stay For charity\'s sweet sake alone. Such solace find we for our loss; And what beyond this thought we crave Comes in the promise from the Cross, Shining upon thy happy grave.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMost Sweet It Is\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.  Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes    To pace the ground, if path be there or none,   While a fair region round the traveller lies   Which he forbears again to look upon;   Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,   The work of Fancy, or some happy tone   Of meditation, slipping in between   The beauty coming and the beauty gone.   If Thought and Love desert us, from that day  Let us break off all commerce with the Muse:  With Thought and Love companions of our way,  Whate\'er the senses take or may refuse,  The Mind\'s internal heaven shall shed her dews  Of inspiration on the humblest lay.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nDesideria\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSURPRISED by joy--impatient as the Wind \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86I turned to share the transport--O! with whom \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86But Thee, deep buried in the silent tomb, That spot which no vicissitude can find? Love, faithful love, recall\'d thee to my mind-- \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86But how could I forget thee? Through what power, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Even for the least division of an hour, Have I been so beguiled as to be blind To my most grievous loss?--That thought\'s return \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Knowing my heart\'s best treasure was no more; That neither present time, nor years unborn \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEvening On Calais Beach\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIT is a beauteous evening, calm and free, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The holy time is quiet as a Nun \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Breathless with adoration; the broad sun Is sinking down in its tranquillity; The gentleness of heaven broods o\'er the sea: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Listen! the mighty Being is awake, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And doth with his eternal motion make A sound like thunder--everlastingly. Dear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86If thou appear untouch\'d by solemn thought, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Thy nature is not therefore less divine: Thou liest in Abraham\'s bosom all the year; \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86And worshipp\'st at the Temple\'s inner shrine, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86God being with thee when we know it not.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNutting\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n---------------------It seems a day (I speak of one from many singled out) One of those heavenly days that cannot die; When, in the eagerness of boyish hope, I left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth With a huge wallet o\'er my shoulders slung, A nutting-crook in hand; and turned my steps Tow\'rd some far-distant wood, a Figure quaint, Tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds Which for that service had been husbanded, By exhortation of my frugal Dame-- Motley accoutrement, of power to smile At thorns, and brakes, and brambles,--and, in truth, More ragged than need was! O\'er pathless rocks, Through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets, Forcing my way, I came to one dear nook Unvisited, where not a broken bough Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign Of devastation; but the hazels rose Tall and erect, with tempting clusters hung, A virgin scene!--A little while I stood, Breathing with such suppression of the heart As joy delights in; and, with wise restraint Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed The banquet;--or beneath the trees I sate Among the flowers, and with the flowers I played; A temper known to those, who, after long And weary expectation, have been blest With sudden happiness beyond all hope. Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves The violets of five seasons re-appear And fade, unseen by any human eye; Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on For ever; and I saw the sparkling foam, And--with my cheek on one of those green stones That, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees, Lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep-- I heard the murmur and the murmuring sound, In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure, The heart luxuriates with indifferent things, Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones, And on the vacant air. Then up I rose, And dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash And merciless ravage: and the shady nook Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower, Deformed and sullied, patiently gave up Their quiet being: and, unless I now Confound my present feelings with the past; Ere from the mutilated bower I turned Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings, I felt a sense of pain when I beheld The silent trees, and saw the intruding sky-- Then, dearest Maiden, move along these shades In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand Touch--for there is a spirit in the woods.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMichael: A Pastoral Poem\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIf from the public way you turn your steps Up the tumultuous brook of Greenhead Ghyll, You will suppose that with an upright path Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent The pastoral mountains front you, face to face. But, courage! for around that boisterous brook The mountains have all opened out themselves, And made a hidden valley of their own. No habitation can be seen; but they Who journey thither find themselves alone With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites That overhead are sailing in the sky. It is in truth an utter solitude; Nor should I have made mention of this Dell But for one object which you might pass by, Might see and notice not. Beside the brook Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones! And to that simple object appertains A story--unenriched with strange events, Yet not unfit, I deem, for the fireside, Or for the summer shade. It was the first Of those domestic tales that spake to me Of shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men Whom I already loved; not verily For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills Where was their occupation and abode. And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy Careless of books, yet having felt the power Of Nature, by the gentle agency Of natural objects, led me on to feel For passions that were not my own, and think (At random and imperfectly indeed) On man, the heart of man, and human life. Therefore, although it be a history Homely and rude, I will relate the same For the delight of a few natural hearts; And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake Of youthful Poets, who among these hills Will be my second self when I am gone. UPON the forest-side in Grasmere Vale There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name; An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb. His bodily frame had been from youth to age Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen, Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs, And in his shepherd\'s calling he was prompt And watchful more than ordinary men. Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds, Of blasts of every tone; and, oftentimes, When others heeded not, He heard the South Make subterraneous music, like the noise Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills. The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock Bethought him, and he to himself would say, "The winds are now devising work for me!" And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives The traveller to a shelter, summoned him Up to the mountains: he had been alone Amid the heart of many thousand mists, That came to him, and left him, on the heights. So lived he till his eightieth year was past. And grossly that man errs, who should suppose That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks, Were things indifferent to the Shepherd\'s thoughts. Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed The common air; hills, which with vigorous step He had so often climbed; which had impressed So many incidents upon his mind Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear; Which, like a book, preserved the memory Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved, Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts The certainty of honourable gain; Those fields, those hills--what could they less? had laid Strong hold on his affections, were to him A pleasurable feeling of blind love, The pleasure which there is in life itself. His days had not been passed in singleness. His Helpmate was a comely matron, old-- Though younger than himself full twenty years. She was a woman of a stirring life, Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool; That small, for flax; and if one wheel had rest It was because the other was at work. The Pair had but one inmate in their house, An only Child, who had been born to them When Michael, telling o\'er his years, began To deem that he was old,--in shepherd\'s phrase, With one foot in the grave. This only Son, With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm, The one of an inestimable worth, Made all their household. I may truly say, That they were as a proverb in the vale For endless industry. When day was gone And from their occupations out of doors The Son and Father were come home, even then, Their labour did not cease; unless when all Turned to the cleanly supper-board, and there, Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk, 0 Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes, And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when the meal Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named) And his old Father both betook themselves To such convenient work as might employ Their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card Wool for the Housewife\'s spindle, or repair Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe, Or other implement of house or field. Down from the ceiling, by the chimney\'s edge, That in our ancient uncouth country style With huge and black projection overbrowed Large space beneath, as duly as the light Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp; An aged utensil, which had performed Service beyond all others of its kind. Early at evening did it burn--and late, Surviving comrade of uncounted hours, Which, going by from year to year, had found, And left, the couple neither gay perhaps Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes, Living a life of eager industry. And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth year, There by the light of this old lamp they sate, Father and Son, while far into the night The Housewife plied her own peculiar work, Making the cottage through the silent hours Murmur as with the sound of summer flies. This light was famous in its neighbourhood, And was a public symbol of the life That thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced, Their cottage on a plot of rising ground Stood single, with large prospect, north and south, High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise, And westward to the village near the lake; And from this constant light, so regular And so far seen, the House itself, by all Who dwelt within the limits of the vale, Both old and young, was named THE EVENING STAR. Thus living on through such a length of years, The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael\'s heart This son of his old age was yet more dear-- Less from instinctive tenderness, the same Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all-- Than that a child, more than all other gifts That earth can offer to declining man, Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts, And stirrings of inquietude, when they By tendency of nature needs must fail. Exceeding was the love he bare to him, His heart and his heart\'s joy! For oftentimes Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms, Had done him female service, not alone For pastime and delight, as is the use Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked His cradle, as with a woman\'s gentle hand. And, in a later time, ere yet the Boy Had put on boy\'s attire, did Michael love, Albeit of a stern unbending mind, To have the Young-one in his sight, when he Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd\'s stool Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched Under the large old oak, that near his door Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade, Chosen for the Shearer\'s covert from the sun, Thence in our rustic dialect was called The CLIPPING TREE, a name which yet it bears. There, while they two were sitting in the shade, With others round them, earnest all and blithe, Would Michael exercise his heart with looks Of fond correction and reproof bestowed Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep By catching at their legs, or with his shouts Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears. And when by Heaven\'s good grace the boy grew up A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek Two steady roses that were five years old; Then Michael from a winter coppice cut With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped With iron, making it throughout in all Due requisites a perfect shepherd\'s staff, And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipt He as a watchman oftentimes was placed At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock; And, to his office prematurely called, There stood the urchin, as you will divine, Something between a hindrance and a help; And for this cause not always, I believe, Receiving from his Father hire of praise; Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice, Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform. But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights, Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways, He with his Father daily went, and they Were as companions, why should I relate That objects which the Shepherd loved before Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came 0 Feelings and emanations--things which were Light to the sun and music to the wind; And that the old Man\'s heart seemed born again? Thus in his Father\'s sight the Boy grew up: And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year, He was his comfort and his daily hope. While in this sort the simple household lived From day to day, to Michael\'s ear there came Distressful tidings. Long before the time Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound In surety for his brother\'s son, a man Of an industrious life, and ample means; But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly Had prest upon him; and old Michael now Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture, A grievous penalty, but little less Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim, At the first hearing, for a moment took More hope out of his life than he supposed That any old man ever could have lost. As soon as he had armed himself with strength To look his trouble in the face, it seemed The Shepherd\'s sole resource to sell at once A portion of his patrimonial fields. Such was his first resolve; he thought again, And his heart failed him. "Isabel," said he, Two evenings after he had heard the news, "I have been toiling more than seventy years, And in the open sunshine of God\'s love Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours Should pass into a stranger\'s hand, I think That I could not lie quiet in my grave. Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself Has scarcely been more diligent than I; And I have lived to be a fool at last To my own family. An evil man That was, and made an evil choice, if he Were false to us; and if he were not false, There are ten thousand to whom loss like this Had been no sorrow. I forgive him;--but \'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus. When I began, my purpose was to speak Of remedies and of a cheerful hope. Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land Shall not go from us, and it shall be free; He shall possess it, free as is the wind That passes over it. We have, thou know\'st, Another kinsman--he will be our friend In this distress. He is a prosperous man, Thriving in trade--and Luke to him shall go, And with his kinsman\'s help and his own thrift He quickly will repair this loss, and then He may return to us. If here he stay, What can be done? Where every one is poor, What can be gained?" At this the old Man paused, And Isabel sat silent, for her mind Was busy, looking back into past times. There\'s Richard Bateman, thought she to herself, He was a parish-boy--at the church-door They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought A basket, which they filled with pedlar\'s wares; And, with this basket on his arm, the lad Went up to London, found a master there, Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy To go and overlook his merchandise Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich, And left estates and monies to the poor, And, at his birth-place, built a chapel, floored With marble which he sent from foreign lands. These thoughts, and many others of like sort, Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel, And her face brightened. The old Man was glad, And thus resumed:--"Well, Isabel! this scheme These two days, has been meat and drink to me. Far more than we have lost is left us yet. --We have enough--I wish indeed that I Were younger;--but this hope is a good hope. --Make ready Luke\'s best garments, of the best Buy for him more, and let us send him forth To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night: --If he \'could\' go, the Boy should go tonight." Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth With a light heart. The Housewife for five days Was restless morn and night, and all day long Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare Things needful for the journey of her son. But Isabel was glad when Sunday came To stop her in her work: for, when she lay By Michael\'s side, she through the last two nights Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep: And when they rose at morning she could see That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon She said to Luke, while they two by themselves Were sitting at the door, "Thou must not go: We have no other Child but thee to lose None to remember--do not go away, For if thou leave thy Father he will die." The Youth made answer with a jocund voice; And Isabel, when she had told her fears, 0 Recovered heart. That evening her best fare Did she bring forth, and all together sat Like happy people round a Christmas fire. With daylight Isabel resumed her work; And all the ensuing week the house appeared As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length The expected letter from their kinsman came, With kind assurances that he would do His utmost for the welfare of the Boy; To which, requests were added, that forthwith He might be sent to him. Ten times or more The letter was read over; Isabel Went forth to show it to the neighbours round; Nor was there at that time on English land A prouder heart than Luke\'s. When Isabel Had to her house returned, the old Man said, "He shall depart to-morrow." To this word The Housewife answered, talking much of things Which, if at such short notice he should go, Would surely be forgotten. But at length She gave consent, and Michael was at ease. Near the tumultuous brook of Greenhead Ghyll, In that deep valley, Michael had designed To build a Sheepfold; and, before he heard The tidings of his melancholy loss, For this same purpose he had gathered up A heap of stones, which by the streamlet\'s edge Lay thrown together, ready for the work. With Luke that evening thitherward he walked: And soon as they had reached the place he stopped, And thus the old Man spake to him:--"My Son, To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart I look upon thee, for thou art the same That wert a promise to me ere thy birth, And all thy life hast been my daily joy. I will relate to thee some little part Of our two histories; \'twill do thee good When thou art from me, even if I should touch On things thou canst not know of.----After thou First cam\'st into the world--as oft befalls To new-born infants--thou didst sleep away Two days, and blessings from thy Father\'s tongue Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on, And still I loved thee with increasing love. Never to living ear came sweeter sounds Than when I heard thee by our own fireside First uttering, without words, a natural tune; While thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy Sing at thy Mother\'s breast. Month followed month, And in the open fields my life was passed And on the mountains; else I think that thou Hadst been brought up upon thy Father\'s knees. But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills, As well thou knowest, in us the old and young Have played together, nor with me didst thou Lack any pleasure which a boy can know." Luke had a manly heart; but at these words He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand, And said, "Nay, do not take it so--I see That these are things of which I need not speak. --Even to the utmost I have been to thee A kind and a good Father: and herein I but repay a gift which I myself Received at others\' hands; for, though now old Beyond the common life of man, I still Remember them who loved me in my youth. Both of them sleep together: here they lived, As all their Forefathers had done; and when At length their time was come, they were not loth To give their bodies to the family mould. I wished that thou should\'st live the life they lived: But, \'tis a long time to look back, my Son, And see so little gain from threescore years. These fields were burthened when they came to me; Till I was forty years of age, not more Than half of my inheritance was mine. I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work, And till these three weeks past the land was free. --It looks as if it never could endure Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke, If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good That thou should\'st go." At this the old Man paused; Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood, Thus, after a short silence, he resumed: "This was a work for us; and now, my Son, It is a work for me. But, lay one stone-- Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands. Nay, Boy, be of good hope;--we both may live To see a better day. At eighty-four I still am strong and hale;--do thou thy part; I will do mine.--I will begin again With many tasks that were resigned to thee: Up to the heights, and in among the storms, Will I without thee go again, and do All works which I was wont to do alone, Before I knew thy face.--Heaven bless thee, Boy! Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast With many hopes; it should be so--yes--yes-- I knew that thou could\'st never have a wish To leave me, Luke: thou hast been bound to me 0 Only by links of love: when thou art gone, What will be left to us!--But, I forget My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone, As I requested; and hereafter, Luke, When thou art gone away, should evil men Be thy companions, think of me, my Son, And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts, And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou May\'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived, Who, being innocent, did for that cause Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well-- When thou return\'st, thou in this place wilt see A work which is not here: a covenant \'Twill be between us; but, whatever fate Befall thee, I shall love thee to the last, And bear thy memory with me to the grave." The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down, And, as his Father had requested, laid The first stone of the Sheepfold. At the sight The old Man\'s grief broke from him; to his heart He pressed his Son, he kissed him and wept; And to the house together they returned. --Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace, Ere the night fell:--with morrow\'s dawn the Boy Began his journey, and when he had reached The public way, he put on a bold face; And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors, Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers, That followed him till he was out of sight. A good report did from their Kinsman come, Of Luke and his well-doing: and the Boy Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news, Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout "The prettiest letters that were ever seen." Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts. So, many months passed on: and once again The Shepherd went about his daily work With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour He to that valley took his way, and there Wrought at the Sheepfold. Meantime Luke began To slacken in his duty; and, at length, He in the dissolute city gave himself To evil courses: ignominy and shame Fell on him, so that he was driven at last To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas. There is a comfort in the strength of love; \'Twill make a thing endurable, which else Would overset the brain, or break the heart: I have conversed with more than one who well Remember the old Man, and what he was Years after he had heard this heavy news. His bodily frame had been from youth to age Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud, And listened to the wind; and, as before, Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep, And for the land, his small inheritance. And to that hollow dell from time to time Did he repair, to build the Fold of which His flock had need. \'Tis not forgotten yet The pity which was then in every heart For the old Man--and \'tis believed by all That many and many a day he thither went, And never lifted up a single stone. There, by the Sheepfold, sometimes was he seen Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog, Then old, beside him, lying at his feet. The length of full seven years, from time to time, He at the building of this Sheepfold wrought, And left the work unfinished when he died. Three years, or little more, did Isabel Survive her Husband: at her death the estate Was sold, and went into a stranger\'s hand. The Cottage which was named the EVENING STAR Is gone--the ploughshare has been through the ground On which it stood; great changes have been wrought In all the neighbourhood:--yet the oak is left That grew beside their door; and the remains Of the unfinished Sheepfold may be seen Beside the boisterous brook of Greenhead Ghyll.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Childless Father\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Up, Timothy, up with your staff and away! Not a soul in the village this morning will stay; The hare has just started from Hamilton\'s grounds, And Skiddaw is glad with the cry of the hounds.\' --Of coats and of jackets grey, scarlet, and green, On the slopes of the pastures all colours were seen; With their comely blue aprons, and caps white as snow, The girls on the hills made a holiday show. Fresh sprigs of green box-wood, not six months before, Filled the funeral basin at Timothy\'s door; A coffin through Timothy\'s threshold had past; One Child did it bear, and that Child was his last. Now fast up the dell came the noise and the fray, The horse and the horn, and the hark! hark away! Old Timothy took up his staff, and he shut With a leisurely motion the door of his hut. Perhaps to himself at that moment he said; \'The key I must take, for my Ellen is dead.\' But of this in my ears not a word did he speak; And he went to the chase with a tear on his cheek.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nComposed During A Storm\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOne who was suffering tumult in his soul, Yet failed to seek the sure relief of prayer, Went forth--his course surrendering to the care Of the fierce wind, while mid-day lightnings prowl Insidiously, untimely thunders growl; While trees, dim-seen, in frenzied numbers, tear The lingering remnant of their yellow hair, And shivering wolves, surprised with darkness, howl As if the sun were not. He raised his eye Soul-smitten; for, that instant, did appear Large space (\'mid dreadful clouds) of purest sky, An azure disc--shield of Tranquillity; Invisible, unlooked-for, minister Of providential goodness ever nigh!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Gravestone Upon The Floor In The Cloisters Of Worcester Cathedral\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'MISERRIMUS,\' and neither name nor date,Prayer, text, or symbol, graven upon the stone;Nought but that word assigned to the unknown,That solitary word--to separateFrom all, and cast a cloud around the fateOf him who lies beneath. Most wretched one,\'Who\' chose his epitaph?--Himself aloneCould thus have dared the grave to agitate,And claim, among the dead, this awful crown;Nor doubt that He marked also for his own Close to these cloistral steps a burial-place,That every foot might fall with heavier tread,Trampling upon his vileness. Stranger, passSoftly!--To save the contrite, Jesus bled.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLucy Iii\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI TRAVELL\'D among unknown men, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86In lands beyond the sea; Nor, England! did I know till then \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86What love I bore to thee. \'Tis past, that melancholy dream! \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Nor will I quit thy shore A second time; for still I seem \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86To love thee more and more. Among thy mountains did I feel \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The joy of my desire; And she I cherish\'d turn\'d her wheel \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Beside an English fire. Thy mornings showed, thy nights conceal\'d, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86The bowers where Lucy played; And thine too is the last green field \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86That Lucy\'s eyes survey\'d.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Birth Of Love\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWhen Love was born of heavenly line, What dire intrigues disturbed Cythera\'s joy! Till Venus cried, \'A mother\'s heart is mine; None but myself shall nurse my boy,\' But, infant as he was, the child In that divine embrace enchanted lay; And, by the beauty of the vase beguiled, Forgot the beverage--and pined away. \'And must my offspring languish in my sight?\' (Alive to all a mother\'s pain, The Queen of Beauty thus her court addressed) \'No: Let the most discreet of all my train Receive him to her breast: Think all, he is the God of young delight.\' Then TENDERNESS with CANDOUR joined, And GAIETY the charming office sought; Nor even DELICACY stayed behind: But none of those fair Graces brought Wherewith to nurse the child--and still he pined. Some fond hearts to COMPLIANCE seemed inclined; But she had surely spoiled the boy: And sad experience forbade a thought On the wild Goddess of VOLUPTUOUS JOY. Long undecided lay th\' important choice, Till of the beauteous court, at length, a voice Pronounced the name of HOPE:--The conscious child Stretched forth his little arms, and smiled. \'Tis said ENJOYMENT (who averred The charge belonged to her alone) Jealous that HOPE had been preferred Laid snares to make the babe her own. Of INNOCENCE the garb she took, The blushing mien and downcast look; And came her services to proffer: And HOPE (what has not Hope believed!) By that seducing air deceived, Accepted of the offer. It happened that, to sleep inclined, Deluded HOPE: for one short hour To that false INNOCENCE\'S power Her little charge consigned. The Goddess then her lap with sweetmeats filled And gave, in handfuls gave, the treacherous store: A wild delirium first the infant thrilled; But soon upon her breast he sunk--to wake no more.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Idiot Boy\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Tis eight o\'clock,--a clear March night, The moon is up,--the sky is blue, The owlet, in the moonlight air, Shouts from nobody knows where; He lengthens out his lonely shout, Halloo! halloo! a long halloo! --Why bustle thus about your door, What means this bustle, Betty Foy? Why are you in this mighty fret? And why on horseback have you set Him whom you love, your Idiot Boy? Scarcely a soul is out of bed; Good Betty, put him down again; His lips with joy they burr at you; But, Betty! what has he to do With stirrup, saddle, or with rein? But Betty\'s bent on her intent; For her good neighbour, Susan Gale, Old Susan, she who dwells alone, Is sick, and makes a piteous moan As if her very life would fail. There\'s not a house within a mile, No hand to help them in distress; Old Susan lies a-bed in pain, And sorely puzzled are the twain, For what she ails they cannot guess. And Betty\'s husband\'s at the wood, Where by the week he doth abide, A woodman in the distant vale; There\'s none to help poor Susan Gale; What must be done? what will betide? And Betty from the lane has fetched Her Pony, that is mild and good; Whether he be in joy or pain, Feeding at will along the lane, Or bringing faggots from the wood. And he is all in travelling trim,-- And, by the moonlight, Betty Foy Has on the well-girt saddle set (The like was never heard of yet) Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. And he must post without delay Across the bridge and through the dale, And by the church, and o\'er the down, To bring a Doctor from the town, Or she will die, old Susan Gale. There is no need of boot or spur, There is no need of whip or wand; For Johnny has his holly-bough, And with a \'hurly-burly\' now He shakes the green bough in his hand. And Betty o\'er and o\'er has told The Boy, who is her best delight, Both what to follow, what to shun, What do, and what to leave undone, How turn to left, and how to right. And Betty\'s most especial charge, Was, \'Johnny! Johnny! mind that you Come home again, nor stop at all,-- Come home again, whate\'er befall, My Johnny, do, I pray you do.\' To this did Johnny answer make, Both with his head and with his hand, And proudly shook the bridle too; And then! his words were not a few, Which Betty well could understand. And now that Johnny is just going, Though Betty\'s in a mighty flurry, She gently pats the Pony\'s side, On which her Idiot Boy must ride, And seems no longer in a hurry. But when the Pony moved his legs, Oh! then for the poor Idiot Boy! For joy he cannot hold the bridle, For joy his head and heels are idle, He\'s idle all for very joy. And while the Pony moves his legs, In Johnny\'s left hand you may see The green bough motionless and dead: The Moon that shines above his head Is not more still and mute than he. His heart it was so full of glee, That till full fifty yards were gone, He quite forgot his holly whip, And all his skill in horsemanship: Oh! happy, happy, happy John. And while the Mother, at the door, Stands fixed, her face with joy o\'erflows, Proud of herself, and proud of him, She sees him in his travelling trim, How quietly her Johnny goes. The silence of her Idiot Boy, What hopes it sends to Betty\'s heart! He\'s at the guide-post--he turns right; She watches till he\'s out of sight, And Betty will not then depart. Burr, burr--now Johnny\'s lips they burr, As loud as any mill, or near it; Meek as a lamb the Pony moves, And Johnny makes the noise he loves, 0 And Betty listens, glad to hear it. Away she hies to Susan Gale: Her Messenger\'s in merry tune; The owlets hoot, the owlets curr, And Johnny\'s lips they burr, burr, burr, As on he goes beneath the moon. His steed and he right well agree; For of this Pony there\'s a rumour, That, should he lose his eyes and ears, And should he live a thousand years, He never will be out of humour. But then he is a horse that thinks! And when he thinks, his pace is slack; Now, though he knows poor Johnny well, Yet, for his life, he cannot tell What he has got upon his back. So through the moonlight lanes they go, And far into the moonlight dale, And by the church, and o\'er the down, To bring a Doctor from the town, To comfort poor old Susan Gale. And Betty, now at Susan\'s side, Is in the middle of her story, What speedy help her Boy will bring, With many a most diverting thing, Of Johnny\'s wit, and Johnny\'s glory. And Betty, still at Susan\'s side, By this time is not quite so flurried: Demure with porringer and plate She sits, as if in Susan\'s fate Her life and soul were buried. But Betty, poor good woman! she, You plainly in her face may read it, Could lend out of that moment\'s store Five years of happiness or more To any that might need it. But yet I guess that now and then With Betty all was not so well; And to the road she turns her ears, And thence full many a sound she hears, Which she to Susan will not tell. Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans; \'As sure as there\'s a moon in heaven,\' Cries Betty, \'he\'ll be back again; They\'ll both be here--\'tis almost ten-- Both will be here before eleven.\' Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans; The clock gives warning for eleven; \'Tis on the stroke--\'He must be near,\' Quoth Betty, \'and will soon be here, As sure as there\'s a moon in heaven.\' The clock is on the stroke of twelve, And Johnny is not yet in sight: --The Moon\'s in heaven, as Betty sees, But Betty is not quite at ease; And Susan has a dreadful night. And Betty, half an hour ago, On Johnny vile reflections cast: \'A little idle sauntering Thing!\' With other names, an endless string; But now that time is gone and past. And Betty\'s drooping at the heart, That happy time all past and gone, \'How can it be he is so late? The Doctor, he has made him wait; Susan! they\'ll both be here anon.\' And Susan\'s growing worse and worse, And Betty\'s in a sad \'quandary\'; And then there\'s nobody to say If she must go, or she must stay! --She\'s in a sad \'quandary\'. The clock is on the stroke of one; But neither Doctor nor his Guide Appears along the moonlight road; There\'s neither horse nor man abroad, And Betty\'s still at Susan\'s side. And Susan now begins to fear Of sad mischances not a few, That Johnny may perhaps be drowned; Or lost, perhaps, and never found; Which they must both for ever rue. She prefaced half a hint of this With, \'God forbid it should be true!\' At the first word that Susan said Cried Betty, rising from the bed, \'Susan, I\'d gladly stay with you. \'I must be gone, I must away: Consider, Johnny\'s but half-wise; Susan, we must take care of him, If he is hurt in life or limb\'-- \'Oh God forbid!\' poor Susan cries. \'What can I do?\' says Betty, going, \'What can I do to ease your pain? Good Susan tell me, and I\'ll stay; I fear you\'re in a dreadful way, But I shall soon be back again.\' \'Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go! There\'s nothing that can ease my pain,\' Then off she hies, but with a prayer That God poor Susan\'s life would spare, 0 Till she comes back again. So, through the moonlight lane she goes, And far into the moonlight dale; And how she ran, and how she walked, And all that to herself she talked, Would surely be a tedious tale. In high and low, above, below, In great and small, in round and square, In tree and tower was Johnny seen, In bush and brake, in black and green; \'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where. And while she crossed the bridge, there came A thought with which her heart is sore-- Johnny perhaps his horse forsook, To hunt the moon within the brook, And never will be heard of more. Now is she high upon the down, Alone amid a prospect wide; There\'s neither Johnny nor his Horse Among the fern or in the gorse; There\'s neither Doctor nor his Guide. \'O saints! what is become of him? Perhaps he\'s climbed into an oak, Where he will stay till he is dead; Or, sadly he has been misled, And joined the wandering gipsy-folk. \'Or him that wicked Pony\'s carried To the dark cave, the goblin\'s hall; Or in the castle he\'s pursuing Among the ghosts his own undoing; Or playing with the waterfall.\' At poor old Susan then she railed, While to the town she posts away; \'If Susan had not been so ill, Alas! I should have had him still, My Johnny, till my dying day.\' Poor Betty, in this sad distemper, The Doctor\'s self could hardly spare: Unworthy things she talked, and wild; Even he, of cattle the most mild, The Pony had his share. But now she\'s fairly in the town, And to the Doctor\'s door she hies; \'Tis silence all on every side; The town so long, the town so wide, Is silent as the skies. And now she\'s at the Doctor\'s door, She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap; The Doctor at the casement shows His glimmering eyes that peep and doze! And one hand rubs his old night-cap. \'O Doctor! Doctor! where\'s my Johnny?\' \'I\'m here, what is\'t you want with me?\' \'O Sir! you know I\'m Betty Foy, And I have lost my poor dear Boy, You know him--him you often see; \'He\'s not so wise as some folks be:\' \'The devil take his wisdom!\' said The Doctor, looking somewhat grim, \'What, Woman! should I know of him?\' And, grumbling, he went back to bed! \'O woe is me! O woe is me! Here will I die, here will I die; I thought to find my lost one here, But he is neither far nor near, Oh! what a wretched Mother I!\' She stops, she stands, she looks about; Which way to turn she cannot tell. Poor Betty! it would ease her pain If she had heart to knock again; --The clock strikes three--a dismal knell! Then up along the town she hies, No wonder if her senses fail; This piteous news so much it shocked her, She quite forgot to send the Doctor, To comfort poor old Susan Gale. And now she\'s high upon the down, And she can see a mile of road: \'O cruel! I\'m almost threescore; Such night as this was ne\'er before, There\'s not a single soul abroad.\' She listens, but she cannot hear The foot of horse, the voice of man; The streams with softest sound are flowing, The grass you almost hear it growing, You hear it now, if e\'er you can. The owlets through the long blue night Are shouting to each other still: Fond lovers! yet not quite hob nob, They lengthen out the tremulous sob, That echoes far from hill to hill. Poor Betty now has lost all hope, Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin, A green-grown pond she just has past, And from the brink she hurries fast, Lest she should drown herself therein. And now she sits her down and weeps; Such tears she never shed before; \'Oh dear, dear Pony! my sweet joy! Oh carry back my Idiot Boy! 0 And we will ne\'er o\'erload thee more.\' A thought is come into her head: The Pony he is mild and good, And we have always used him well; Perhaps he\'s gone along the dell, And carried Johnny to the wood. Then up she springs as if on wings; She thinks no more of deadly sin; If Betty fifty ponds should see, The last of all her thoughts would be To drown herself therein. O Reader! now that I might tell What Johnny and his Horse are doing What they\'ve been doing all this time, Oh could I put it into rhyme, A most delightful tale pursuing! Perhaps, and no unlikely thought! He with his Pony now doth roam The cliffs and peaks so high that are, To lay his hands upon a star, And in his pocket bring it home. Perhaps he\'s turned himself about, His face unto his horse\'s tail, And, still and mute, in wonder lost, All silent as a horseman-ghost, He travels slowly down the vale. And now, perhaps, is hunting sheep, A fierce and dreadful hunter he; Yon valley, now so trim and green, In five months\' time, should he be seen, A desert wilderness will be! Perhaps, with head and heels on fire, And like the very soul of evil, He\'s galloping away, away, And so will gallop on for aye, The bane of all that dread the devil! I to the Muses have been bound These fourteen years, by strong indentures: O gentle Muses! let me tell But half of what to him befell; He surely met with strange adventures. O gentle Muses! is this kind? Why will ye thus my suit repel? Why of your further aid bereave me? And can ye thus unfriended leave me Ye Muses! whom I love so well? Who\'s yon, that, near the waterfall, Which thunders down with headlong force, Beneath the moon, yet shining fair, As careless as if nothing were, Sits upright on a feeding horse? Unto his horse--there feeding free, He seems, I think, the rein to give; Of moon or stars he takes no heed; Of such we in romances read: --\'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live. And that\'s the very Pony, too! Where is she, where is Betty Foy? She hardly can sustain her fears; The roaring waterfall she hears, And cannot find her Idiot Boy. Your Pony\'s worth his weight in gold: Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy! She\'s coming from among the trees, And now all full in view she sees Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy. And Betty sees the Pony too: Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy? It is no goblin, \'tis no ghost, \'Tis he whom you so long have lost, He whom you love, your Idiot Boy. She looks again--her arms are up-- She screams--she cannot move for joy; She darts, as with a torrent\'s force, She almost has o\'erturned the Horse, And fast she holds her Idiot Boy. And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud; Whether in cunning or in joy I cannot tell; but while he laughs, Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs To hear again her Idiot Boy. And now she\'s at the Pony\'s tail, And now is at the Pony\'s head,-- On that side now, and now on this; And, almost stifled with her bliss, A few sad tears does Betty shed. She kisses o\'er and o\'er again Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy; She\'s happy here, is happy there, She is uneasy every where; Her limbs are all alive with joy. She pats the Pony, where or when She knows not, happy Betty Foy! The little Pony glad may be, But he is milder far than she, You hardly can perceive his joy. \'Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor; You\'ve done your best, and that is all:\' She took the reins, when this was said, And gently turned the Pony\'s head 0 From the loud waterfall. By this the stars were almost gone, The moon was setting on the hill, So pale you scarcely looked at her: The little birds began to stir, Though yet their tongues were still. The Pony, Betty, and her Boy, Wind slowly through the woody dale; And who is she, betimes abroad, That hobbles up the steep rough road? Who is it, but old Susan Gale? Long time lay Susan lost in thought; And many dreadful fears beset her, Both for her Messenger and Nurse; And, as her mind grew worse and worse, Her body--it grew better. She turned, she tossed herself in bed, On all sides doubts and terrors met her; Point after point did she discuss; And, while her mind was fighting thus, Her body still grew better. \'Alas! what is become of them? These fears can never be endured; I\'ll to the wood.\'--The word scarce said, Did Susan rise up from her bed, As if by magic cured. Away she goes up hill and down, And to the wood at length is come; She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting; Oh me! it is a merry meeting As ever was in Christendom. The owls have hardly sung their last, While our four travellers homeward wend; The owls have hooted all night long, And with the owls began my song, And with the owls must end. For while they all were travelling home, Cried Betty, \'Tell us, Johnny, do, Where all this long night you have been, What you have heard, what you have seen: And, Johnny, mind you tell us true.\' Now Johnny all night long had heard The owls in tuneful concert strive; No doubt too he the moon had seen; For in the moonlight he had been From eight o\'clock till five. And thus, to Betty\'s question, he Made answer, like a traveller bold, (His very words I give to you,) \'The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo, And the sun did shine so cold!\' --Thus answered Johnny in his glory, And that was all his travel\'s story,\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Morning Exercise\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFANCY, who leads the pastimes of the glad,Full oft is pleased a wayward dart to throw;Sending sad shadows after things not sad,Peopling the harmless fields with signs of woe:Beneath her sway, a simple forest cryBecomes an echo of man\'s misery.Blithe ravens croak of death; and when the owlTries his two voices for a favourite strain--\'Tu-whit--Tu-whoo!\' the unsuspecting fowlForebodes mishap or seems but to complain; Fancy, intent to harass and annoy,Can thus pervert the evidence of joy.Through border wilds where naked Indians stray,Myriads of notes attest her subtle skill;A feathered task-master cries, \'WORK AWAY!\'And, in thy iteration, \'WHIP POOR WILL!\'Is heard the spirit of a toil-worn slave,Lashed out of life, not quiet in the grave.What wonder? at her bidding, ancient laysSteeped in dire grief the voice of Philomel; And that fleet messenger of summer days,The Swallow, twittered subject to like spell;But ne\'er could Fancy bend the buoyant LarkTo melancholy service--hark!

It was composed at school, and during my two first College vacations. There is not an image in it which I have not observed; and now, in my seventy-third year, I recollect the time and place where most of them were noticed. I will confine myself to one instance: "Waving his hat, the shepherd, from the vale, Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale,-- The dog, loud barking, \'mid the glittering rocks, Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks." I was an eye-witness of this for the first time while crossing the Pass of Dunmail Raise. Upon second thought, I will mention another image: "And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines." This is feebly and imperfectly expressed, but I recollect distinctly the very spot where this first struck me. It was in the way between Hawkshead and Ambleside, and gave me extreme pleasure. The moment was important in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been unnoticed by the poets of any age or country, so far as I was acquainted with them; and I made a resolution to supply, in some degree, the deficiency. I could not have been at that time above fourteen years of age. The description of the swans, that follows, was taken from the daily opportunities I had of observing their habits, not as confined to the gentleman\'s park, but in a state of nature. There were two pairs of them that divided the lake of Esthwaite and its in-and-out-flowing streams between them, never trespassing a single yard upon each other\'s separate domain. They were of the old magnificent species, bearing in beauty and majesty about the same relation to the Thames swan which that does to the goose. It was from the remembrance of those noble creatures I took, thirty years after, the picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of Dion. While I was a schoolboy, the late Mr. Curwen introduced a little fleet of those birds, but of the inferior species, to the lake of Windermere. Their principal home was about his own island; but they sailed about into remote parts of the lake, and, either from real or imagined injury done to the adjoining fields, they were got rid of at the request of the farmers and proprietors, but to the great regret of all who had become attached to them, from noticing their beauty and quiet habits. I will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place,--a proof (of which I was unconscious at the time) of my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance. The country is idealised rather than described in any one of its local aspects.

FAR from my dearest Friend, \'tis mine to rove Through bare grey dell, high wood, and pastoral cove; Where Derwent rests, and listens to the roar That stuns the tremulous cliffs of high Lodore; Where peace to Grasmere\'s lonely island leads, To willowy hedge-rows, and to emerald meads; Leads to her bridge, rude church, and cottaged grounds, Her rocky sheepwalks, and her woodland bounds; Where, undisturbed by winds, Winander sleeps \'Mid clustering isles, and holly-sprinkled steeps; Where twilight glens endear my Esthwaite\'s shore, And memory of departed pleasures, more. Fair scenes, erewhile, I taught, a happy child, The echoes of your rocks my carols wild: The spirit sought not then, in cherished sadness, A cloudy substitute for failing gladness, In youth\'s keen eye the livelong day was bright, The sun at morning, and the stars at night, Alike, when first the bittern\'s hollow bill Was heard, or woodcocks roamed the moonlight hill. In thoughtless gaiety I coursed the plain, And hope itself was all I knew of pain; For then, the inexperienced heart would beat At times, while young Content forsook her seat, And wild Impatience, pointing upward, showed, Through passes yet unreached, a brighter road. Alas! the idle tale of man is found Depicted in the dial\'s moral round; Hope with reflection blends her social rays To gild the total tablet of his days; Yet still, the sport of some malignant power, He knows but from its shade the present hour. But why, ungrateful, dwell on idle pain? To show what pleasures yet to me remain, Say, will my Friend, with unreluctant ear, The history of a poet\'s evening hear? When, in the south, the wan noon, brooding still, Breathed a pale steam around the glaring hill, And shades of deep-embattled clouds were seen, Spotting the northern cliffs with lights between; When crowding cattle, checked by rails that make A fence far stretched into the shallow lake, Lashed the cool water with their restless tails, Or from high points of rock looked out for fanning gales: When school-boys stretched their length upon the green; And round the broad-spread oak, a glimmering scene, In the rough fern-clad park, the herded deer Shook the still-twinkling tail and glancing ear; When horses in the sunburnt intake stood, And vainly eyed below the tempting flood, Or tracked the passenger, in mute distress, With forward neck the closing gate to press-- Then, while I wandered where the huddling rill Brightens with water-breaks the hollow ghyll As by enchantment, an obscure retreat Opened at once, and stayed my devious feet. While thick above the rill the branches close, In rocky basin its wild waves repose, Inverted shrubs, and moss of gloomy green, Cling from the rocks, with pale wood-weeds between; And its own twilight softens the whole scene, Save where aloft the subtle sunbeams shine On withered briars that o\'er the crags recline; Save where, with sparkling foam, a small cascade Illumines, from within, the leafy shade; Beyond, along the vista of the brook, Where antique roots its bustling course o\'erlook, The eye reposes on a secret bridge Half grey, half shagged with ivy to its ridge; There, bending o\'er the stream, the listless swain Lingers behind his disappearing wain. --Did Sabine grace adorn my living line, Blandusia\'s praise, wild stream, should yield to thine! Never shall ruthless minister of death \'Mid thy soft glooms the glittering steel unsheath; No goblets shall, for thee, be crowned with flowers, No kid with piteous outcry thrill thy bowers; The mystic shapes that by thy margin rove A more benignant sacrifice approve-- A mind, that, in a calm angelic mood Of happy wisdom, meditating good, Beholds, of all from her high powers required, Much done, and much designed, and more desired,-- Harmonious thoughts, a soul by truth refined, Entire affection for all human kind. Dear Brook, farewell! To-morrow\'s noon again Shall hide me, wooing long thy wildwood strain; But now the sun has gained his western road, And eve\'s mild hour invites my steps abroad. While, near the midway cliff, the silvered kite In many a whistling circle wheels her flight; Slant watery lights, from parting clouds, apace Travel along the precipice\'s base; Cheering its naked waste of scattered stone, By lichens grey, and scanty moss, o\'ergrown; Where scarce the foxglove peeps, or thistle\'s beard; And restless stone-chat, all day long, is heard. How pleasant, as the sun declines, to view The spacious landscape change in form and hue! Here, vanish, as in mist, before a flood 0 Of bright obscurity, hill, lawn, and wood; There, objects, by the searching beams betrayed, Come forth, and here retire in purple shade; Even the white stems of birch, the cottage white, Soften their glare before the mellow light; The skiffs, at anchor where with umbrage wide Yon chestnuts half the latticed boat-house hide, Shed from their sides, that face the sun\'s slant beam, Strong flakes of radiance on the tremulous stream: Raised by yon travelling flock, a dusty cloud Mounts from the road, and spreads its moving shroud; The shepherd, all involved in wreaths of fire, Now shows a shadowy speck, and now is lost entire. Into a gradual calm the breezes sink, A blue rim borders all the lake\'s still brink; There doth the twinkling aspen\'s foliage sleep, And insects clothe, like dust, the glassy deep: And now, on every side, the surface breaks Into blue spots, and slowly lengthening streaks; Here, plots of sparkling water tremble bright With thousand thousand twinkling points of light; There, waves that, hardly weltering, die away, Tip their smooth ridges with a softer ray; And now the whole wide lake in deep repose Is hushed, and like a burnished mirror glows, Save where, along the shady western marge, Coasts, with industrious oar, the charcoal barge. Their panniered train a group of potters goad, Winding from side to side up the steep road; The peasant, from yon cliff of fearful edge Shot, down the headlong path darts with his sledge; Bright beams the lonely mountain-horse illume Feeding \'mid purple heath, "green rings," and broom; While the sharp slope the slackened team confounds, Downward the ponderous timber-wain resounds; In foamy breaks the rill, with merry song, Dashed o\'er the rough rock, lightly leaps along; From lonesome chapel at the mountain\'s feet, Three humble bells their rustic chime repeat; Sounds from the water-side the hammered boat; And \'blasted\' quarry thunders, heard remote! Even here, amid the sweep of endless woods, Blue pomp of lakes, high cliffs, and falling floods, Not undelightful are the simplest charms, Found by the grassy door of mountain-farms. Sweetly ferocious, round his native walks, Pride of his sister-wives, the monarch stalks; Spur-clad his nervous feet, and firm his tread; A crest of purple tops the warrior\'s head. Bright sparks his black and rolling eye-ball hurls Afar, his tail he closes and unfurls; On tiptoe reared, he strains his clarion throat, Threatened by faintly-answering farms remote: Again with his shrill voice the mountain rings, While, flapped with conscious pride, resound his wings. Where, mixed with graceful birch, the sombrous pine And yew-tree o\'er the silver rocks recline; I love to mark the quarry\'s moving trains, Dwarf panniered steeds, and men, and numerous wains; How busy all the enormous hive within, While Echo dallies with its various din! Some (hear yon not their chisels\' clinking sound?) Toil, small as pigmies in the gulf profound; Some, dim between the lofty cliffs descried, O\'erwalk the slender plank from side to side; These, by the pale-blue rocks that ceaseless ring, In airy baskets hanging, work and sing. Just where a cloud above the mountain rears An edge all flame, the broadening sun appears; A long blue bar its aegis orb divides, And breaks the spreading of its golden tides; And now that orb has touched the purple steep Whose softened image penetrates the deep. \'Cross the calm lake\'s blue shades the cliffs aspire, With towers and woods, a "prospect all on fire;" While coves and secret hollows, through a ray Of fainter gold, a purple gleam betray. Each slip of lawn the broken rocks between Shines in the light with more than earthly green: Deep yellow beams the scattered stems illume, Far in the level forest\'s central gloom: Waving his hat, the shepherd, from the vale, Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale,-- The dog, loud barking, \'mid the glittering rocks, Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks. Where oaks o\'erhang the road the radiance shoots On tawny earth, wild weeds, and twisted roots; The druid-stones a brightened ring unfold; And all the babbling brooks are liquid gold; Sunk to a curve, the day-star lessens still, Gives one bright glance, and drops behind the hill. In these secluded vales, if village fame, Confirmed by hoary hairs, belief may claim; When up the hills, as now, retired the light, Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd\'s sight. The form appears of one that spurs his steed Midway along the hill with desperate speed; Unhurt pursues his lengthened flight, while all Attend, at every stretch, his headlong fall. Anon, appears a brave, a gorgeous show 0 Of horsemen-shadows moving to and fro; At intervals imperial banners stream, And now the van reflects the solar beam; The rear through iron brown betrays a sullen gleam. While silent stands the admiring crowd below, Silent the visionary warriors go, Winding in ordered pomp their upward way Till the last banner of the long array Has disappeared, and every trace is fled Of splendour--save the beacon\'s spiry head Tipt with eve\'s latest gleam of burning red. Now, while the solemn evening shadows sail, On slowly-waving pinions, down the vale; And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines; \'Tis pleasant near the tranquil lake to stray Where, winding on along some secret bay, The swan uplifts his chest, and backward flings His neck, a varying arch, between his towering wings: The eye that marks the gliding creature sees How graceful, pride can be, and how majestic, ease, While tender cares and mild domestic loves With furtive watch pursue her as she moves, The female with a meeker charm succeeds, And her brown little-ones around her leads, Nibbling the water lilies as they pass, Or playing wanton with the floating grass. She, in a mother\'s care, her beauty\'s pride Forgetting, calls the wearied to her side; Alternately they mount her back, and rest Close by her mantling wings\' embraces prest. Long may they float upon this flood serene; Theirs be these holms untrodden, still, and green, Where leafy shades fence off the blustering gale, And breathes in peace the lily of the vale! Yon isle, which feels not even the milkmaid\'s feet, Yet hears her song, "by distance made more sweet," Yon isle conceals their home, their hut-like bower; Green water-rushes overspread the floor; Long grass and willows form the woven wall, And swings above the roof the poplar tall. Thence issuing often with unwieldy stalk, They crush with broad black feet their flowery walk; Or, from the neighbouring water, hear at morn The hound, the horse\'s tread, and mellow horn; Involve their serpent-necks in changeful rings, Rolled wantonly between their slippery wings, Or, starting up with noise and rude delight, Force half upon the wave their cumbrous flight. Fair Swan! by all a mother\'s joys caressed, Haply some wretch has eyed, and called thee blessed; When with her infants, from some shady seat By the lake\'s edge, she rose--to face the noontide heat; Or taught their limbs along the dusty road A few short steps to totter with their load. I see her now, denied to lay her head, On cold blue nights, in hut or straw-built shed, Turn to a silent smile their sleepy cry, By pointing to the gliding moon on high. --When low-hung clouds each star of summer hide, And fireless are the valleys far and wide, Where the brook brawls along the public road Dark with bat-haunted ashes stretching broad, Oft has she taught them on her lap to lay The shining glow-worm; or, in heedless play, Toss it from hand to hand, disquieted; While others, not unseen, are free to shed Green unmolested light upon their mossy bed. Oh! when the sleety showers her path assail, And like a torrent roars the headstrong gale; No more her breath can thaw their fingers cold, Their frozen arms her neck no more can fold; Weak roof a cowering form two babes to shield, And faint the fire a dying heart can yield! Press the sad kiss, fond mother! vainly fears Thy flooded cheek to wet them with its tears; No tears can chill them, and no bosom warms, Thy breast their death-bed, coffined in thine arms! Sweet are the sounds that mingle from afar, Heard by calm lakes, as peeps the folding star, Where the duck dabbles \'mid the rustling sedge, And feeding pike starts from the water\'s edge, Or the swan stirs the reeds, his neck and bill Wetting, that drip upon the water still; And heron, as resounds the trodden shore, Shoots upward, darting his long neck before. Now, with religious awe, the farewell light Blends with the solemn colouring of night; \'Mid groves of clouds that crest the mountain\'s brow, And round the west\'s proud lodge their shadows throw, Like Una shining on her gloomy way, The half-seen form of Twilight roams astray; Shedding, through paly loop-holes mild and small, Gleams that upon the lake\'s still bosom fall; Soft o\'er the surface creep those lustres pale Tracking the motions of the fitful gale. With restless interchange at once the bright Wins on the shade, the shade upon the light. No favoured eye was e\'er allowed to gaze On lovelier spectacle in faery days; 0 When gentle Spirits urged a sportive chase, Brushing with lucid wands the water\'s face: While music, stealing round the glimmering deeps, Charmed the tall circle of the enchanted steeps. --The lights are vanished from the watery plains: No wreck of all the pageantry remains. Unheeded night has overcome the vales: On the dark earth the wearied vision fails; The latest lingerer of the forest train, The lone black fir, forsakes the faded plain; Last evening sight, the cottage smoke, no more, Lost in the thickened darkness, glimmers hoar; And, towering from the sullen dark-brown mere, Like a black wall, the mountain-steeps appear. --Now o\'er the soothed accordant heart we feel A sympathetic twilight slowly steal, And ever, as we fondly muse, we find The soft gloom deepening on the tranquil mind. Stay! pensive, sadly-pleasing visions, stay! Ah no! as fades the vale, they fade away: Yet still the tender, vacant gloom remains; Still the cold cheek its shuddering tear retains. The bird, who ceased, with fading light, to thread Silent the hedge or steamy rivulet\'s bed, From his grey re-appearing tower shall soon Salute with gladsome note the rising moon, While with a hoary light she frosts the ground, And pours a deeper blue to Aether\'s bound; Pleased, as she moves, her pomp of clouds to fold In robes of azure, fleecy-white, and gold. Above yon eastern hill, where darkness broods O\'er all its vanished dells, and lawns, and woods; Where but a mass of shade the sight can trace, Even now she shews, half-veiled, her lovely face: Across the gloomy valley flings her light, Far to the western slopes with hamlets white; And gives, where woods the chequered upland strew, To the green corn of summer, autumn\'s hue. Thus Hope, first pouring from her blessed horn Her dawn, far lovelier than the moon\'s own morn, Till higher mounted, strives in vain to cheer The weary hills, impervious, blackening near; Yet does she still, undaunted, throw the while On darling spots remote her tempting smile. Even now she decks for me a distant scene, (For dark and broad the gulf of time between) Gilding that cottage with her fondest ray, (Sole bourn, sole wish, sole object of my way; How fair its lawns and sheltering woods appear! How sweet its streamlet murmurs in mine ear!) Where we, my Friend, to happy days shall rise, Till our small share of hardly-paining sighs (For sighs will ever trouble human breath) Creep hushed into the tranquil breast of death. But now the clear bright Moon her zenith gains, And, rimy without speck, extend the plains: The deepest cleft the mountain\'s front displays Scarce hides a shadow from her searching rays; From the dark-blue faint silvery threads divide The hills, while gleams below the azure tide; Time softly treads; throughout the landscape breathes A peace enlivened, not disturbed, by wreaths Of charcoal-smoke, that o\'er the fallen wood, Steal down the hill, and spread along the flood. The song of mountain-streams, unheard by day, Now hardly heard, beguiles my homeward way. Air listens, like the sleeping water, still, To catch the spiritual music of the hill, Broke only by the slow clock tolling deep, Or shout that wakes the ferry-man from sleep, The echoed hoof nearing the distant shore, The boat\'s first motion--made with dashing oar; Sound of closed gate, across the water borne, Hurrying the timid hare through rustling corn; The sportive outcry of the mocking owl; And at long intervals the mill-dog\'s howl; The distant forge\'s swinging thump profound; Or yell, in the deep woods, of lonely hound.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nUpon Westminster Bridge\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEARTH has not anything to show more fair: \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Dull would he be of soul who could pass by \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86A sight so touching in its majesty: This City now doth like a garment wear The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie \\\'86\\\'86\\\'86Open unto the fields, and to the sky; All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.

Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he   That every man in arms should wish to be?   --It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought   Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought   Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:   Whose high endeavours are an inward light   That makes the path before him always bright;   Who, with a natural instinct to discern   What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;  Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,  But makes his moral being his prime care;  Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,  And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!  Turns his necessity to glorious gain;  In face of these doth exercise a power  Which is our human nature\'s highest dower:  Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves  Of their bad influence, and their good receives:  By objects, which might force the soul to abate  Her feeling, rendered more compassionate;  Is placable--because occasions rise  So often that demand such sacrifice;  More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,  As tempted more; more able to endure,  As more exposed to suffering and distress;  Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.  --\'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends  Upon that law as on the best of friends;  Whence, in a state where men are tempted still  To evil for a guard against worse ill,  And what in quality or act is best  Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,  He labours good on good to fix, and owes  To virtue every triumph that he knows:  --Who, if he rise to station of command,  Rises by open means; and there will stand  On honourable terms, or else retire,  And in himself possess his own desire;  Who comprehends his trust, and to the same  Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;  And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait  For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;  Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,  Like showers of manna, if they come at all:  Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,  Or mild concerns of ordinary life,  A constant influence, a peculiar grace;  But who, if he be called upon to face  Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined  Great issues, good or bad for human kind,  Is happy as a Lover; and attired  With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;  And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law  In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;  Or if an unexpected call succeed,  Come when it will, is equal to the need:  --He who, though thus endued as with a sense  And faculty for storm and turbulence,  Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans  To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;  Sweet images! which, wheresoe\'er he be,  Are at his heart; and such fidelity  It is his darling passion to approve;  More brave for this, that he hath much to love:--  \'Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,  Conspicuous object in a Nation\'s eye,  Or left unthought-of in obscurity,--  Who, with a toward or untoward lot,  Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--  Plays, in the many games of life, that one  Where what he most doth value must be won:  Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,  Nor thought of tender happiness betray;  Who, not content that former worth stand fast,  Looks forward, persevering to the last,  From well to better, daily self-surpast:  Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth  For ever, and to noble deeds give birth,  Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,  And leave a dead unprofitable name--  Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;  And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws  His breath in confidence of Heaven\'s applause:  This is the happy Warrior; this is he  That every man in arms should wish to be.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMemory\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA pen--to register; a key-- That winds through secret wards Are well assigned to Memory By allegoric Bards. As aptly, also, might be given A Pencil to her hand; That, softening objects, sometimes even Outstrips the heart\'s demand; That smooths foregone distress, the lines Of lingering care subdues, Long-vanished happiness refines, And clothes in brighter hues; Yet, like a tool of Fancy, works Those Spectres to dilate That startle Conscience, as she lurks Within her lonely seat. Oh! that our lives, which flee so fast, In purity were such, That not an image of the past Should fear that pencil\'s touch! Retirement then might hourly look Upon a soothing scene, Age steal to his allotted nook Contented and serene; With heart as calm as lakes that sleep, In frosty moonlight glistening; Or mountain rivers, where they creep Along a channel smooth and deep, To their own far-off murmurs listening.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLines Written In Early Spring\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI HEARD a thousand blended notes,While in a grove I sate reclined,In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughtsBring sad thoughts to the mind.To her fair works did Nature linkThe human soul that through me ran;And much it grieved my heart to thinkWhat man has made of man.Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;And \'tis my faith that every flowerEnjoys the air it breathes.The birds around me hopped and played,Their thoughts I cannot measure:---But the least motion which they made,It seemed a thrill of pleasure.The budding twigs spread out their fan,To catch the breezy air;And I must think, do all I can,That there was pleasure there.If this belief from heaven be sent,If such be Nature\'s holy plan,Have I not reason to lamentWhat man has made of man?\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLucy Gray, Or Solitude\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOft I had heard of Lucy Gray: And, when I crossed the wild, I chanced to see at break of day The solitary child. No mate, no comrade Lucy knew; She dwelt on a wide moor, - The sweetest thing that ever grew Beside a human door! You yet may spy the fawn at play, The hare upon the green; But the sweet face of Lucy Gray Will never more be seen. \'To-night will be a stormy night-  You to the town must go; And take a lantern, Child, to light Your mother through the snow.\' \'That, Father! will I gladly do: \'Tis scarcely afternoon-  The minster-clock has just struck two, And yonder is the moon! \' At this the Father raised his hook, And snapped a faggot-band; He plied his work; - and Lucy took The lantern in her hand. Not blither is the mountain roe: With many a wanton stroke Her feet disperse the powdery snow, That rises up like smoke. The storm came on before its time: She wandered up and down; And many a hill did Lucy climb: But never reached the town. The wretched parents all that night Went shouting far and wide; But there was neither sound nor sight To serve them for a guide. At day-break on a hill they stood That overlooked the moor; And thence they saw the bridge of wood, A furlong from their door. They wept- and, turning homeward, cried, \'In heaven we all shall meet; \' - When in the snow the mother spied The print of Lucy\'s feet. Then downwards from the steep hill\'s edge They tracked the footmarks small; And through the broken hawthorn hedge, And by the long stone-wall; And then an open field they crossed: The marks were still the same; They tracked them on, nor ever lost; And to the bridge they came. They followed from the snowy bank Those footmarks, one by one, Into the middle of the plank; And further there were none! - Yet some maintain that to this day She is a living child; That you may see sweet Lucy Gray Upon the lonesome wild. O\'er rough and smooth she trips along, And never looks behind; And sings a solitary song That whistles in the wind.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNuns Fret Not At Their Convent\'s Narrow Room\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nNuns fret not at their convent\'s narrow room; And hermits are contented with their cells; And students with their pensive citadels; Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom, High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells, Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells: In truth the prison, unto which we doom Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me, In sundry moods, \'twas pastime to be bound Within the Sonnet\'s scanty plot of ground; Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be) Who have felt the weight of too much liberty, Should find brief solace there, as I have found.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIt Is A Beauteous Evening\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIt is a beauteous evening, calm and free, The holy time is quiet as a nun Breathless with adoration; the broad sun Is sinking down in its tranquility; The gentleness of heaven broods o\'er the sea: Listen! the mighty Being is awake, And doth with his eternal motion make A sound like thunder - everlastingly. Dear Child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here, If thou appear untouched by solemn thought, Thy nature is not therefore less divine: Thou liest in Abraham\'s bosom all the year, And worship\'st at the Temple\'s inner shrine, God being with thee when we know it not.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWritten In March\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe cock is crowing, The stream is flowing, The small birds twitter, The lake doth glitter The green field sleeps in the sun; The oldest and youngest Are at work with the strongest; The cattle are grazing, Their heads never raising; There are forty feeding like one! Like an army defeated The snow hath retreated, And now doth fare ill On the top of the bare hill; The plowboy is whooping- anon-anon: There\'s joy in the mountains; There\'s life in the fountains; Small clouds are sailing, Blue sky prevailing; The rain is over and gone!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAfter-Thought\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.   I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,    As being past away.--Vain sympathies!   For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,   I see what was, and is, and will abide;   Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;   The Form remains, the Function never dies;   While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,   We Men, who in our morn of youth defied   The elements, must vanish;--be it so!  Enough, if something from our hands have power  To live, and act, and serve the future hour;  And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,  Through love, through hope, and faith\'s transcendent dower,  We feel that we are greater than we know.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nPerfect Woman\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nSHE was a phantom of delight When first she gleam\'d upon my sight; A lovely apparition, sent To be a moment\'s ornament; Her eyes as stars of twilight fair; Like twilight\'s, too, her dusky hair; But all things else about her drawn From May-time and the cheerful dawn; A dancing shape, an image gay, To haunt, to startle, and waylay. I saw her upon nearer view, A Spirit, yet a Woman too! Her household motions light and free, And steps of virgin liberty; A countenance in which did meet Sweet records, promises as sweet; A creature not too bright or good For human nature\'s daily food; For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles. And now I see with eye serene The very pulse of the machine; A being breathing thoughtful breath, A traveller between life and death; The reason firm, the temperate will, Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill; A perfect Woman, nobly plann\'d, To warn, to comfort, and command; And yet a Spirit still, and bright With something of angelic light.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Flower Garden At Coleorton Hall, Leicestershire.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nTELL me, ye Zephyrs! that unfold,While fluttering o\'er this gay Recess,Pinions that fanned the teeming mouldOf Eden\'s blissful wilderness,Did only softly-stealing hoursThere close the peaceful lives of flowers?Say, when the \'moving\' creatures sawAll kinds commingled without fear,Prevailed a like indulgent lawFor the still growths that prosper here?Did wanton fawn and kid forbearThe half-blown rose, the lily spare?Or peeped they often from their bedsAnd prematurely disappeared,Devoured like pleasure ere it spreadsA bosom to the sun endeared?If such their harsh untimely doom,It falls not \'here\' on bud or bloom.All summer long the happy EveOf this fair Spot her flowers may bind,Nor e\'er, with ruffled fancy, grieve,From the next glance she casts, to findThat love for little things by FateIs rendered vain as love for great.Yet, where the guardian fence is wound,So subtly are our eyes beguiledWe see not nor suspect a bound,No more than in some forest wild;The sight is free as air--or crostOnly by art in nature lost.And, though the jealous turf refuseBy random footsteps to be prest,And feed on never-sullied dews,\'Ye\', gentle breezes from the west,With all the ministers of hopeAre tempted to this sunny slope!And hither throngs of birds resort;Some, inmates lodged in shady nests,Some, perched on stems of stately portThat nod to welcome transient guests;While hare and leveret, seen at play,\'Appear\' not more shut out than they.Apt emblem (for reproof of pride)This delicate Enclosure showsOf modest kindness, that would hideThe firm protection she bestows;Of manners, like its viewless fence,Ensuring peace to innocence.Thus spake the moral Muse--her wingAbruptly spreading to depart,She left that farewell offering,Momento for some docile heart;That may respect the good old ageWhen Fancy was Truth\'s willing Page;And Truth would skim the flowery glade,Though entering but as Fancy\'s Shade.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Poet! He Hath Put His Heart To School\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n.    A poet!--He hath put his heart to school,   Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff   Which art hath lodged within his hand--must laugh   By precept only, and shed tears by rule.   Thy Art be Nature; the live current quaff,   And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,   In fear that else, when Critics grave and cool   Have killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph.   How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold?  Because the lovely little flower is free  Down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;  And so the grandeur of the Forest-tree  Comes not by casting in a formal mould,  But from its own divine vitality.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Wren\'s Nest\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nAMONG the dwellings framed by birds     In field or forest with nice care,Is none that with the little Wren\'s     In snugness may compare.No door the tenement requires,     And seldom needs a laboured roof;Yet is it to the fiercest sun     Impervious, and storm-proof.So warm, so beautiful withal,     In perfect fitness for its aim,That to the Kind by special grace     Their instinct surely came.And when for their abodes they seek     An opportune recess,The hermit has no finer eye     For shadowy quietness.These find, \'mid ivied abbey-walls,     A canopy in some still nook;Others are pent-housed by a brae     That overhangs a brook.There to the brooding bird her mate     Warbles by fits his low clear song;And by the busy streamlet both     Are sung to all day long.Or in sequestered lanes they build,     Where, till the flitting bird\'s return,Her eggs within the nest repose,     Like relics in an urn.But still, where general choice is good,     There is a better and a best;And, among fairest objects, some     Are fairer than the rest;This, one of those small builders proved     In a green covert, where, from outThe forehead of a pollard oak,     The leafy antlers sprout;For She who planned the mossy lodge,     Mistrusting her evasive skill,Had to a Primrose looked for aid     Her wishes to fulfill. High on the trunk\'s projecting brow,     And fixed an infant\'s span aboveThe budding flowers, peeped forth the nest     The prettiest of the grove!The treasure proudly did I show     To some whose minds without disdainCan turn to little things; but once     Looked up for it in vain:\'Tis gone---a ruthless spoiler\'s prey,     Who heeds not beauty, love, or song,\'Tis gone! (so seemed it) and we grieved     Indignant at the wrong.Just three days after, passing by     In clearer light the moss-built cellI saw, espied its shaded mouth;     And felt that all was well.The Primrose for a veil had spread     The largest of her upright leaves;And thus, for purposes benign,     A simple flower deceives.Concealed from friends who might disturb     Thy quiet with no ill intent,Secure from evil eyes and hands     On barbarous plunder bent,Rest, Mother-bird! and when thy young     Take flight, and thou art free to roam,When withered is the guardian Flower,     And empty thy late home,Think how ye prospered, thou and thine,     Amid the unviolated groveHoused near the growing Primrose-tuft     In foresight, or in love.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Poet\'s Epitaph\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nArt thou a Statist in the van Of public conflicts trained and bred? --First learn to love one living man; \'Then\' may\'st thou think upon the dead. A Lawyer art thou?--draw not nigh! Go, carry to some fitter place The keenness of that practised eye, The hardness of that sallow face. Art thou a Man of purple cheer? A rosy Man, right plump to see? Approach; yet, Doctor, not too near, This grave no cushion is for thee. Or art thou one of gallant pride, A Soldier and no man of chaff? Welcome!--but lay thy sword aside, And lean upon a peasant\'s staff. Physician art thou? one, all eyes, Philosopher! a fingering slave, One that would peep and botanise Upon his mother\'s grave? Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece, O turn aside,--and take, I pray, That he below may rest in peace, Thy ever-dwindling soul, away! A Moralist perchance appears; Led, Heaven knows how! to this poor sod: And he has neither eyes nor ears; Himself his world, and his own God; One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling Nor form, nor feeling, great or small; A reasoning, self-sufficing thing, An intellectual All-in-all! Shut close the door; press down the latch; Sleep in thy intellectual crust; Nor lose ten tickings of thy watch Near this unprofitable dust. But who is He, with modest looks, And clad in homely russet brown? He murmurs near the running brooks A music sweeter than their own. He is retired as noontide dew, Or fountain in a noon-day grove; And you must love him, ere to you He will seem worthy of your love. The outward shows of sky and earth, Of hill and valley, he has viewed; And impulses of deeper birth Have come to him in solitude. In common things that round us lie Some random truths he can impart,-- The harvest of a quiet eye That broods and sleeps on his own heart. But he is weak; both Man and Boy, Hath been an idler in the land; Contented if he might enjoy The things which others understand. --Come hither in thy hour of strength; Come, weak as is a breaking wave! Here stretch thy body at full length; Or build thy house upon this grave.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWith Ships The Sea Was Sprinkled Far And Nigh\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWith ships the sea was sprinkled far and nigh, Like stars in heaven, and joyously it showed; Some lying fast at anchor in the road, Some veering up and down, one knew not why. A goodly vessel did I then espy Come like a giant from a haven broad; And lustily along the bay she strode, Her tackling rich, and of apparel high. The ship was nought to me, nor I to her, Yet I pursued her with a lover\'s look; This ship to all the rest did I prefer: When will she turn, and whither? She will brook No tarrying; where she comes the winds must stir: On went she, and due north her journey took.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Tis Said, That Some Have Died For Love\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n\'Tis said, that some have died for love: And here and there a churchyard grave is found In the cold north\'s unhallowed ground, Because the wretched man himself had slain, His love was such a grievous pain. And there is one whom I five years have known; He dwells alone Upon Helvellyn\'s side: He loved--the pretty Barbara died; And thus he makes his moan: Three years had Barbara in her grave been laid When thus his moan he made: \'Oh, move, thou Cottage, from behind that oak! Or let the aged tree uprooted lie, That in some other way yon smoke May mount into the sky! The clouds pass on; they from the heavens depart. I look--the sky is empty space; I know not what I trace; But when I cease to look, my hand is on my heart. \'Oh! what a weight is in these shades! Ye leaves, That murmur once so dear, when will it cease? Your sound my heart of rest bereaves, It robs my heart of peace. Thou Thrush, that singest loud--and loud and free, Into yon row of willows flit, Upon that alder sit; Or sing another song, or choose another tree. \'Roll back, sweet Rill! back to thy mountain-bounds, And there for ever be thy waters chained! For thou dost haunt the air with sounds That cannot be sustained; If still beneath that pine-tree\'s ragged bough Headlong yon waterfall must come, Oh let it then be dumb! Be anything, sweet Rill, but that which thou art now. \'Thou Eglantine, so bright with sunny showers, Proud as a rainbow spanning half the vale, Thou one fair shrub, oh! shed thy flowers, And stir not in the gale. For thus to see thee nodding in the air, To see thy arch thus stretch and bend, Thus rise and thus descend,-- Disturbs me till the sight is more than I can dear.\' The Man who makes this feverish complaint Is one of giant stature, who could dance Equipped from head to foot in iron mail. Ah gentle Love! if ever thought was thine To store up kindred hours for me, thy face Turn from me, gentle Love! nor let me walk Within the sound of Emma\'s voice, nor know Such happiness as I have known to-day.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere Is An Eminence,--Of These Our Hills\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere is an Eminence,--of these our hills The last that parleys with the setting sun; We can behold it from our orchard-seat; And, when at evening we pursue out walk Along the public way, this Peak, so high Above us, and so distant in its height, Is visible; and often seems to send Its own deep quiet to restore our hearts. The meteors make of it a favourite haunt: The star of Jove, so beautiful and large In the mid heavens, is never half so fair As when he shines above it. \'Tis in truth The loneliest place we have among the clouds. And She who dwells with me, whom I have loved With such communion, that no place on earth Can ever be a solitude to me, Hath to this lonely Summit given my Name.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nWe Are Seven\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n--------A Simple Child, That lightly draws its breath, And feels its life in every limb, What should it know of death? I met a little cottage Girl: She was eight years old, she said; Her hair was thick with many a curl That clustered round her head. She had a rustic, woodland air, And she was wildly clad: Her eyes were fair, and very fair; --Her beauty made me glad. "Sisters and brothers, little Maid, How many may you be?" "How many? Seven in all," she said And wondering looked at me. "And where are they? I pray you tell." She answered, "Seven are we; And two of us at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea. "Two of us in the church-yard lie, My sister and my brother; And, in the church-yard cottage, I Dwell near them with my mother." "You say that two at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea, Yet ye are seven!--I pray you tell, Sweet Maid, how this may be." Then did the little Maid reply, "Seven boys and girls are we; Two of us in the church-yard lie, Beneath the church-yard tree." "You run about, my little Maid, Your limbs they are alive; If two are in the church-yard laid, Then ye are only five." "Their graves are green, they may be seen," The little Maid replied, "Twelve steps or more from my mother\'s door, And they are side by side. "My stockings there I often knit, My kerchief there I hem; And there upon the ground I sit, And sing a song to them. "And often after sunset, Sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little porringer, And eat my supper there. "The first that died was sister Jane; In bed she moaning lay, Till God released her of her pain; And then she went away. "So in the church-yard she was laid; And, when the grass was dry, Together round her grave we played, My brother John and I. "And when the ground was white with snow, And I could run and slide, My brother John was forced to go, And he lies by her side." "How many are you, then," said I, "If they two are in heaven?" Quick was the little Maid\'s reply, "O Master! we are seven." "But they are dead; those two are dead! Their spirits are in heaven!" \'Twas throwing words away; for still The little Maid would have her will, And said, "Nay, we are seven!"\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nComposed Upon Westminster Bridge, September 3, 1802\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nEarth has not anything to show more fair:Dull would he be of soul who could pass byA sight so touching in its majesty:This City now doth, like a garment, wearThe beauty of the morning; silent, bare,Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lieOpen unto the fields, and to the sky;All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.Never did sun more beautifully steepIn his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;Ne\'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!The river glideth at his own sweet will:Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;And all that mighty heart is lying still!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBy The Seaside\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe sun is couched, the sea-fowl gone to rest, And the wild storm hath somewhere found a nest; Air slumbers--wave with wave no longer strives, Only a heaving of the deep survives, A tell-tale motion! soon will it be laid, And by the tide alone the water swayed. Stealthy withdrawings, interminglings mild Of light with shade in beauty reconciled-- Such is the prospect far as sight can range, The soothing recompence, the welcome change. Where, now, the ships that drove before the blast, Threatened by angry breakers as they passed; And by a train of flying clouds bemocked; Or, in the hollow surge, at anchor rocked As on a bed of death? Some lodge in peace, Saved by His care who bade the tempest cease; And some, too heedless of past danger, court Fresh gales to waft them to the far-off port But near, or hanging sea and sky between, Not one of all those winged powers is seen, Seen in her course, nor \'mid this quiet heard; Yet oh! how gladly would the air be stirred By some acknowledgment of thanks and praise, Soft in its temper as those vesper lays Sung to the Virgin while accordant oars Urge the slow bark along Calabrian shores; A sea-born service through the mountains felt Till into one loved vision all things melt: Or like those hymns that soothe with graver sound The gulfy coast of Norway iron-bound; And, from the wide and open Baltic, rise With punctual care, Lutherian harmonies. Hush, not a voice is here! but why repine, Now when the star of eve comes forth to shine On British waters with that look benign? Ye mariners, that plough your onward way, Or in the haven rest, or sheltering bay, May silent thanks at least to God be given With a full heart; "our thoughts are \'heard\' in heaven."\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Slumber Did My Spirit Seal\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA slumber did my spirit sealI had no human fears:She seemed a thing that could not feelThe touch of earthly years. No motion has she now, no force;She neither hears nor sees;Rolled round in earth\'s diurnal course,With rocks, and stones, and trees.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Farewell\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFAREWELL, thou little Nook of mountain-ground,Thou rocky corner in the lowest stairOf that magnificent temple which doth boundOne side of our whole vale with grandeur rare;Sweet garden-orchard, eminently fair,The loveliest spot that man hath ever found,Farewell!--we leave thee to Heaven\'s peaceful care,Thee, and the Cottage which thou dost surround.Our boat is safely anchored by the shore,And there will safely ride when we are gone; The flowering shrubs that deck our humble doorWill prosper, though untended and alone:Fields, goods, and far-off chattels we have none:These narrow bounds contain our private storeOf things earth makes, and sun doth shine upon;Here are they in our sight--we have no more.Sunshine and shower be with you, bud and bell!For two months now in vain we shall be sought:We leave you here in solitude to dwellWith these our latest gifts of tender thought; Thou, like the morning, in thy saffron coat,Bright gowan, and marsh-marigold, farewell!Whom from the borders of the Lake we brought,And placed together near our rocky Well.We go for One to whom ye will be dear;And she will prize this Bower, this Indian shed,Our own contrivance, Building without peer!--A gentle Maid, whose heart is lowly bred,Whose pleasures are in wild fields gathered,With joyousness, and with a thoughtful cheer, Will come to you; to you herself will wed;And love the blessed life that we lead here.Dear Spot! which we have watched with tender heed,Bringing thee chosen plants and blossoms blownAmong the distant mountains, flower and weed,Which thou hast taken to thee as thy own,Making all kindness registered and known;Thou for our sakes, though Nature\'s child indeed,Fair in thyself and beautiful alone,Hast taken gifts which thou dost little need. And O most constant, yet most fickle Place,Thou hast thy wayward moods, as thou dost showTo them who look not daily on thy face;Who, being loved, in love no bounds dost know,And say\'st, when we forsake thee, \'Let them go!\'Thou easy-hearted Thing, with thy wild raceOf weeds and flowers, till we return be slow,And travel with the year at a soft pace.Help us to tell Her tales of years gone by,And this sweet spring, the best beloved and best; Joy will be flown in its mortality;Something must stay to tell us of the rest.Here, thronged with primroses, the steep rock\'s breastGlittered at evening like a starry sky;And in this bush our sparrow built her nest,Of which I sang one song that will not die.O happy Garden! whose seclusion deepHath been so friendly to industrious hours;And to soft slumbers, that did gently steepOur spirits, carrying with them dreams of flowers, And wild notes warbled among leafy bowers;Two burning months let summer overleap,And, coming back with Her who will be ours,Into thy bosom we again shall creep.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nOde On Intimations Of Immortality From Recollections Of Early Childhood\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Child is father of the Man;                          And I could wish my days to be                         Bound each to each by natural piety.                       I  There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, The earth, and every common sight,         To me did seem       Apparelled in celestial light, The glory and the freshness of a dream. It is not now as it hath been of yore; -        Turn wheresoe\'er I may,         By night or day, The things which I have seen I now can see no more.                       II      The Rainbow comes and goes,     And lovely is the Rose,     The Moon doth with delight   Look round her when the heavens are bare;      Waters on a starry night     Are beautiful and fair;    The sunshine is a glorious birth;    But yet I know, where\'er I go, That there hath past away a glory from the earth.                       III  Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,   And while the young lambs bound     As to the tabor\'s sound, To me alone there came a thought of grief: A timely utterance gave that thought relief,     And I again am strong: The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;  No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;  I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng, The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,     And all the earth is gay;          Land and sea   Give themselves up to jollity,     And with the heart of May   Doth every Beast keep holiday; -      Thou Child of Joy, Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!                        IV  Ye blesse`d Creatures, I have heard the call   Ye to each other make; I see The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;    My heart is at your festival,     My head hath its coronal, The fulness of your bliss, I feel- I feel it all.     Oh evil day! if I were sullen     While the Earth herself is adorning,       This sweet May-morning,     And the Children are culling       On every side,     In a thousand valleys far and wide,     Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm, And the Babe leaps up on his Mother\'s arm:-      I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!      - But there\'s a Tree, of many, one, A single Field which I have looked upon, Both of them speak of something that is gone:       The Pansy at my feet       Doth the same tale repeat: Whither is fled the visionary gleam?  Where is it now, the glory and the dream?                        V  Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The Soul that rises with us, our life\'s Star,     Hath had elsewhere its setting,       And cometh from afar:     Not in entire forgetfulness,     And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come     From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy!  Shades of the prison-house begin to close     Upon the growing Boy, But He beholds the light, and whence it flows,     He sees it in his joy;  The Youth, who daily farther from the east     Must travel, still is Nature\'s Priest,     And by the vision splendid     Is on his way attended;  At length the Man perceives it die away, And fade into the light of common day.                       VI  Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;  Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind, And, even with something of a Mother\'s mind,     And no unworthy aim,     The homely Nurse doth all she can To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man,     Forget the glories he hath known, And that imperial palace whence he came.                       VII  Behold the Child among his new-born blisses, A six years\' Darling of a pigmy size!  See, where \'mid work of his own hand he lies, Fretted by sallies of his mother\'s kisses, With light upon him from his father\'s eyes!  See, at his feet, some little plan or chart, Some fragment from his dream of human life, Shaped by himself with newly-learned art;    A wedding or a festival,   A mourning or a funeral;      And this hath now his heart,   And unto this he frames his song:     Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business, love, or strife;      But it will not be long     Ere this be thrown aside,   And with new joy and pride The little Actor cons another part;  Filling from time to time his \'humorous stage\' With all the Persons, down to palsied Age, That Life brings with her in her equipage;      As if his whole vocation     Were endless imitation.                       VIII  Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie     Thy Soul\'s immensity;  Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind, That, deaf and silent, read\'st the eternal deep, Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,-      Might Prophet! Seer blest!      On whom those truths do rest, Which we are toiling all our lives to find, In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;  Thou, over whom thy Immortality Broods like the Day, a Master o\'er a Slave, A Presence which is not to be put by;        [To whom the grave Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight     Of day or the warm light, A place of thought where we in waiting lie; ] Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might Of heaven-born freedom on thy being\'s height, Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke The years to bring the inevitable yoke, Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?  Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight, And custom lie upon thee with a weight, Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!                        IX      O joy! that in our embers     Is something that doth live,     That nature yet remembers     What was so fugitive!  The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction: not indeed For that which is most worthy to be blest;  Delight and liberty, the simple creed Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:-      Not for these I raise     The song of thanks and praise;    But for those obstinate questionings   Of sense and outward things,   Fallings from us, vanishings;    Blank misgivings of a Creature Moving about in worlds not realised, High instincts before which our mortal Nature Did tremble like a guilty Thing surprised:     But for those first affections,     Those shadowy recollections,   Which, be they what they may, Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;    Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,       To perish never;  Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavor,       Nor Man nor Boy, Nor all that is at enmity with joy, Can utterly abolish or destroy!    Hence in a season of calm weather     Though inland far we be, Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea     Which brought us hither,   Can in a moment travel thither, And see the Children sport upon the shore, And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.                       X  Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!      And yet the young Lambs bound     As to the tabor\'s sound!  We in thought will join your throng,     Ye that pipe and ye that play,     Ye that through your hearts to-day     Feel the gladness of the May!  What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now for ever taken from my sight,   Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;      We will grieve not, rather find     Strength in what remains behind;      In the primal sympathy     Which having been must ever be;      In the soothing thoughts that spring     Out of human suffering;      In the faith that looks through death, In years that bring the philosophic mind.                       XI  And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves, Forebode not any severing of our loves!  Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;  I only have relinquished one delight To live beneath your more habitual sway. I love the Brooks which down their channels fret, Even more than when I tripped lightly as they;  The innocent brightness of a new-born Day       Is lovely yet;  The Clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o\'er man\'s mortality;  Another race hath been, and other palms are won. Thanks to the human heart by which we live, Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.                          [comp. 1802-1804(?): publ. 1807]\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nStrange Fits Of Passion Have I Known\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nStrange fits of passion have I known:And I will dare to tell,But in the lover\'s ear alone,What once to me befell.When she I loved looked every dayFresh as a rose in June,I to her cottage bent my way,Beneath an evening-moon.Upon the moon I fixed my eye,All over the wide lea;With quickening pace my horse drew nighThose paths so dear to me.And now we reached the orchard-plot;And, as we climbed the hill,The sinking moon to Lucy\'s cotCame near, and nearer still.In one of those sweet dreams I slept,Kind Nature\'s gentlest boon!And all the while my eye I keptOn the descending moon.My horse moved on; hoof after hoofHe raised, and never stopped:When down behind the cottage roof,At once, the bright moon dropped.What fond and wayward thoughts will slideInto a Lover\'s head!\'O mercy!\' to myself I cried,\'If Lucy hould be dead!\'\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMy Heart Leaps Up\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nMy heart leaps up when I behold  A rainbow in the sky:So was it when my life began; So is it now I am a man; So be it when I shall grow old,  Or let me die!The Child is father of the Man;And I could wish my days to beBound each to each by natural piety.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Narrow Girdle Of Rough Stones And Crags\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA narrow girdle of rough stones and crags, A rude and natural causeway, interposed Between the water and a winding slope Of copse and thicket, leaves the eastern shore Of Grasmere safe in its own privacy: And there myself and two beloved Friends, One calm September morning, ere the mist Had altogether yielded to the sun, Sauntered on this retired and difficult way. ----Ill suits the road with one in haste; but we Played with our time; and, as we strolled along, It was our occupation to observe Such objects as the waves had tossed ashore-- Feather, or leaf, or weed, or withered bough, Each on the other heaped, along the line Of the dry wreck. And, in our vacant mood, Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft Of dandelion seed or thistle\'s beard, That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake, Suddenly halting now--a lifeless stand! And starting off again with freak as sudden; In all its sportive wanderings, all the while, Making report of an invisible breeze That was its wings, its chariot, and its horse, Its playmate, rather say, its moving soul. --And often, trifling with a privilege Alike indulged to all, we paused, one now, And now the other, to point out, perchance To pluck, some flower or water-weed, too fair Either to be divided from the place On which it grew, or to be left alone To its own beauty. Many such there are, Fair ferns and flowers, and chiefly that tall fern, So stately, of the queen Osmunda named; Plant lovelier, in its own retired abode On Grasmere\'s beach, than Naiad by the side Of Grecian brook, or Lady of the Mere, Sole-sitting by the shores of old romance. --So fared we that bright morning: from the fields Meanwhile, a noise was heard, the busy mirth Of reapers, men and women, boys and girls. Delighted much to listen to those sounds, And feeding thus our fancies, we advanced Along the indented shore; when suddenly, Through a thin veil of glittering haze was seen Before us, on a point of jutting land, The tall and upright figure of a Man Attired in peasant\'s garb, who stood alone, Angling beside the margin of the lake. \'Improvident and reckless,\' we exclaimed, \'The Man must be, who thus can lose a day Of the mid harvest, when the labourer\'s hire Is ample, and some little might be stored Wherewith to cheer him in the winter time.\' Thus talking of that Peasant, we approached Close to the spot where with his rod and line He stood alone; whereat he turned his head To greet us--and we saw a Mam worn down By sickness, gaunt and lean, with sunken cheeks And wasted limbs, his legs so long and lean That for my single self I looked at them, Forgetful of the body they sustained.-- Too weak to labour in the harvest field, The Man was using his best skill to gain A pittance from the dead unfeeling lake That knew not of his wants. I will not say What thoughts immediately were ours, nor how The happy idleness of that sweet morn, With all its lovely images, was changed To serious musing and to self-reproach. Nor did we fail to see within ourselves What need there is to be reserved in speech, And temper all our thoughts with charity. --Therefore, unwilling to forget that day, My Friend, Myself, and She who then received The same admonishment, have called the place By a memorial name, uncouth indeed As e\'er by mariner was given to bay Or foreland, on a new-discovered coast; And POINT RASH-JUDGMENT is the name it bears.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Whirl-Blast From Behind The Hill\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Whirl-Blast from behind the hill Rushed o\'er the wood with startling sound; Then--all at once the air was still, And showers of hailstones pattered round. Where leafless oaks towered high above, I sat within an undergrove Of tallest hollies, tall and green; A fairer bower was never seen. From year to year the spacious floor With withered leaves is covered o\'er, And all the year the bower is green. But see! where\'er the hailstones drop The withered leaves all skip and hop; There\'s not a breeze--no breath of air-- Yet here, and there, and everywhere Along the floor, beneath the shade By those embowering hollies made, The leaves in myriads jump and spring, As if with pipes and music rare Some Robin Good-fellow were there, And all those leaves, in festive glee, Were dancing to the minstrelsy.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCalm Is All Nature As A Resting Wheel\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nCalm is all nature as a resting wheel. The kine are couched upon the dewy grass; The horse alone, seen dimly as I pass, Is cropping audibly his later meal: Dark is the ground; a slumber seems to steal O\'er vale, and mountain, and the starless sky. Now, in this blank of things, a harmony, Home-felt, and home-created, comes to heal That grief for which the senses still supply Fresh food; for only then, when memory Is hushed, am I at rest. My Friends! restrain Those busy cares that would allay my pain; Oh! leave me to myself, nor let me feel The officious touch that makes me droop again.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Night-Piece\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n------The sky is overcast With a continuous cloud of texture close, Heavy and wan, all whitened by the Moon, Which through that veil is indistinctly seen, A dull, contracted circle, yielding light So feebly spread, that not a shadow falls, Chequering the ground--from rock, plant, tree, or tower. At length a pleasant instantaneous gleam Startles the pensive traveller while he treads His lonesome path, with unobserving eye Bent earthwards; he looks up--the clouds are split Asunder,--and above his head he sees The clear Moon, and the glory of the heavens. There, in a black-blue vault she sails along, Followed by multitudes of stars, that, small And sharp, and bright, along the dark abyss Drive as she drives: how fast they wheel away, Yet vanish not!--the wind is in the tree, But they are silent;--still they roll along Immeasurably distant; and the vault, Built round by those white clouds, enormous clouds, Still deepens its unfathomable depth. At length the Vision closes; and the mind, Not undisturbed by the delight it feels, Which slowly settles into peaceful calm, Is left to muse upon the solemn scene.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Complaint\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThere is a change--and I am poor;Your love hath been, nor long ago,A fountain at my fond heart\'s door,Whose only business was to flow;And flow it did; not taking heedOf its own bounty, or my need.What happy moments did I count!Blest was I then all bliss above!Now, for that consecrated fountOf murmuring, sparkling, living love,What have I? Shall I dare to tell?A comfortless and hidden well.A well of love--it may be deep--I trust it is,--and never dry:What matter? If the waters sleepIn silence and obscurity.--Such change, and at the very doorOf my fond heart, hath made me poor.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLines Composed A Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nFive years have past; five summers, with the length Of five long winters! and again I hear These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs With a soft inland murmur.--Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, That on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect The landscape with the quiet of the sky. The day is come when I again repose Here, under this dark sycamore, and view These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, Which at this season, with their unripe fruits, Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves \'Mid groves and copses. Once again I see These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke Sent up, in silence, from among the trees! With some uncertain notice, as might seem Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, Or of some Hermit\'s cave, where by his fire The Hermit sits alone. These beauteous forms, Through a long absence, have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man\'s eye: But oft, in lonely rooms, and \'mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; And passing even into my purer mind, With tranquil restoration:--feelings too Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, As have no slight or trivial influence On that best portion of a good man\'s life, His little, nameless, unremembered, acts Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, To them I may have owed another gift, Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, In which the burthen of the mystery, In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world, Is lightened:--that serene and blessed mood, In which the affections gently lead us on,-- Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul: While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things. If this Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft-- In darkness and amid the many shapes Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, Have hung upon the beatings of my heart-- How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro\' the woods, How often has my spirit turned to thee! And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, With many recognitions dim and faint, And somewhat of a sad perplexity, The picture of the mind revives again: While here I stand, not only with the sense Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts That in this moment there is life and food For future years. And so I dare to hope, Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first I came among these hills; when like a roe I bounded o\'er the mountains, by the sides Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, Wherever nature led: more like a man Flying from something that he dreads, than one Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then (The coarser pleasures of my boyish days, And their glad animal movements all gone by) To me was all in all.--I cannot paint What then I was. The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to me An appetite; a feeling and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, nor any interest Unborrowed from the eye.--That time is past, And all its aching joys are now no more, And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts Have followed; for such loss, I would believe, Abundant recompence. For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes The still, sad music of humanity, Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue. And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man; A motion and a spirit, that impels 0 All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods, And mountains; and of all that we behold From this green earth; of all the mighty world Of eye, and ear,--both what they half create, And what perceive; well pleased to recognise In nature and the language of the sense, The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul Of all my moral being. Nor perchance, If I were not thus taught, should I the more Suffer my genial spirits to decay: For thou art with me here upon the banks Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend, My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch The language of my former heart, and read My former pleasures in the shooting lights Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while May I behold in thee what I was once, My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make, Knowing that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her; \'tis her privilege, Through all the years of this our life, to lead From joy to joy: for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life, Shall e\'er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk; And let the misty mountain-winds be free To blow against thee: and, in after years, When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, Thy memory be as a dwelling-place For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then, If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me, And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance-- If I should be where I no more can hear Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence--wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together; and that I, so long A worshipper of Nature, hither came Unwearied in that service: rather say With warmer love--oh! with far deeper zeal Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget, That after many wanderings, many years Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, And this green pastoral landscape, were to me More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe Solitary Reaper\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nBehold her, single in the field,     Yon solitary Highland Lass!     Reaping and singing by herself;     Stop here, or gently pass!     Alone she cuts and binds the grain,     And sings a melancholy strain;     O listen! for the Vale profound     Is overflowing with the sound.     No Nightingale did ever chaunt     More welcome notes to weary bands     Of travellers in some shady haunt,     Among Arabian sands:     A voice so thrilling ne\'er was heard     In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,     Breaking the silence of the seas     Among the farthest Hebrides.     Will no one tell me what she sings?--     Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow     For old, unhappy, far-off things,     And battles long ago:     Or is it some more humble lay,     Familiar matter of to-day?     Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,     That has been, and may be again?     Whate\'er the theme, the Maiden sang     As if her song could have no ending;     I saw her singing at her work,     And o\'er the sickle bending;--     I listened, motionless and still;     And, as I mounted up the hill,     The music in my heart I bore,     Long after it was heard no more.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIt Was An April Morning: Fresh And Clear\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nIt was an April morning: fresh and clear The Rivulet, delighting in its strength, Ran with a young man\'s speed; and yet the voice Of waters which the winter had supplied Was softened down into a vernal tone. The spirit of enjoyment and desire, And hopes and wishes, from all living things Went circling, like a multitude of sounds. The budding groves seemed eager to urge on The steps of June; as if their various hues Were only hindrances that stood between Them and their object: but, meanwhile, prevailed Such an entire contentment in the air That every naked ash, and tardy tree Yet leafless, showed as if the countenance With which it looked on this delightful day Were native to the summer.--Up the brook I roamed in the confusion of my heart, Alive to all things and forgetting all. At length I to a sudden turning came In this continuous glen, where down a rock The Stream, so ardent in its course before, Sent forth such sallies of glad sound, that all Which I till then had heard, appeared the voice Of common pleasure: beast and bird, the lamb, The shepherd\'s dog, the linnet and the thrush Vied with this waterfall, and made a song, Which, while I listened, seemed like the wild growth Or like some natural produce of the air, That could not cease to be. Green leaves were here; But \'twas the foliage of the rocks--the birch, The yew, the holly, and the bright green thorn, With hanging islands of resplendent furze: And, on a summit, distant a short space, By any who should look beyond the dell, A single mountain-cottage might be seen. I gazed and gazed, and to myself I said, \'Our thoughts at least are ours; and this wild nook, My EMMA, I will dedicate to thee.\' ----Soon did the spot become my other home, My dwelling, and my out-of-doors abode. And, of the Shepherds who have seen me there, To whom I sometimes in our idle talk Have told this fancy, two or three, perhaps, Years after we are gone and in our graves, When they have cause to speak of this wild place, May call it by the name of EMMA\'S DELL.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe World Is Too Much With Us; Late And Soon\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nThe world is too much with us; late and soon,     Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:     Little we see in Nature that is ours;     We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!     This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;     The winds that will be howling at all hours,     And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;     For this, for everything, we are out of tune,     It moves us not.--Great God! I\'d rather be     A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;     So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,     Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;     Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea;     Or hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Night Thought\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nLo! where the Moon along the skySails with her happy destiny;Oft is she hid from mortal eyeOr dimly seen,But when the clouds asunder flyHow bright her mien!Far different we--a froward race,Thousands though rich in Fortune\'s graceWith cherished sullenness of paceTheir way pursue, Ingrates who wear a smileless faceThe whole year through.If kindred humours e\'er would makeMy spirit droop for drooping\'s sake,From Fancy following in thy wake,Bright ship of heaven!A counter impulse let me takeAnd be forgiven.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nShe Dwelt Among The Untrodden Ways\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nShe dwelt among the untrodden ways     Beside the springs of Dove,Maid whom there were none to praise     And very few to love:A violet by a mossy stone     Half hidden from the eye!---Fair as a star, when only one     Is shining in the sky.She lived unknown, and few could know     When Lucy ceased to be;But she is in her grave, and, oh,     The difference to me!\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nA Character\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI marvel how Nature could ever find space For so many strange contrasts in one human face: There\'s thought and no thought, and there\'s paleness and bloom And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom. There\'s weakness, and strength both redundant and vain; Such strength as, if ever affliction and pain Could pierce through a temper that\'s soft to disease, Would be rational peace--a philosopher\'s ease. There\'s indifference, alike when he fails or succeeds, And attention full ten times as much as there needs; Pride where there\'s no envy, there\'s so much of joy; And mildness, and spirit both forward and coy. There\'s freedom, and sometimes a diffident stare Of shame scarcely seeming to know that she\'s there, There\'s virtue, the title it surely may claim, Yet wants heaven knows what to be worthy the name. This picture from nature may seem to depart, Yet the Man would at once run away with your heart; And I for five centuries right gladly would be Such an odd such a kind happy creature as he.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI Wandered Lonely As A Cloud (Daffodils)\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\nI wandered lonely as a cloudThat floats on high o\'er vales and hills,When all at once I saw a crowd,A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees,Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.Continuous as the stars that shineAnd twinkle on the milky way,They stretched in never-ending lineAlong the margin of a bay:Ten thousand saw I at a glance,Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.The waves beside them danced; but theyOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:A poet could not but be gay,In such a jocund company:I gazed- and gazed- but little thoughtWhat wealth the show to me had brought:For oft, when on my couch I lieIn vacant or in pensive mood,They flash upon that inward eyeWhich is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills,And dances with the daffodils.\r\\\n\r\\\n\r\\\n}'
